                            ALGOL COMPILATION DIAGNOSTICS


Syntax errors discovered by the ALGOL Compiler are indicated by five (5) asterisks
and an error number on the line below the one containing the error. The symbol
"^" appears below the symbol which caused the error.

Due to the syntactic structure of ALGOL and the Compiler, it is possible for an
error to introduce errors. Therefore, error messages after the first in a program
may be spurious.
