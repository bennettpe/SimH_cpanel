                             FORTRAN/ALGOL INPUT/OUTPUT DIAGNOSTICS


During execution of an object program, diagnostics may be printed on the Standard
Teleprinter Output unit by the input/output routine (FRMTR) supplied for FORTRAN
nd ALGOL programs. t  When a halt occurs, the A-Register contains a code which
further defines the nature of the error:

t The object program need not be generated by FORTRAN or ALGOL; Assembler
  language programs can refer to FRMTR through the entry point .DIO.
