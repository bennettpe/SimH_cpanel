                                PREPARE CONTROL SYSTEM


DESCRIPTION 

The Prepare Control System (PCS) program processes relocatable modules of the
Basic Control System and produces an absolute version designed to work on a spe-
cific hardware configuration. It creates operating units from the relocatable object
tapes of the Input/Output Control subroutine, .IOC., the equipment driver sub-
routines, and the Relocating Loader. It also establishes the contents of certain
locations used in interrupt handling.

The Prepare Control System is an absolute program which is loaded by the Basic
Binary Loader. It operates on a minimum configuration of 4K memory and a 2752A
Teleprinter. However, if a 2737A Punched Tape Reader and a 2753A Tape Punch
are available, the Prepare Control System will utilize these devices; PCS requests
their assignment during the Initialization phase.

After the Initialization phase is completed, each module of BCS is loaded and proc-
essed by PCS. The order in which the modules are processed is not significant ex-
cept that the BCS Loader must be the last module loaded. Two modules, the Input/
Output Control subroutine and the Loader, require that parameters be entered via
the Keyboard Input unit after being loaded.

Options are available to define the equipment driver modules and other BCS system
subroutines as relocatable programs to be loaded with the user's object program.

OPERATING PROCEDURES 

The following procedures indicate the sequence of steps for loading and execution of
the Prepare Control System:

A. Set Teleprinter to LINE and check that all equipment to be used is operable.

B. Load the Prepare Control System tape using the Basic Binary Loader.

C. Set Switch Register to 002000, press LOAD ADDRESS.

D. Set Switches 5-0 to the value of the channel number for the printer/punch unit
   (the lower numbered of the two assigned channels) of the Teleprinter.

E. Press RUN.

The Initialization Phase is executed. During this phase, the following messages
may occur:

  which consists of a carriage return, (CR) , and a line feed, (LF). If an error
  is made in typing a reply, type (RUBOUT) (CR) (LF) and repeat the reply.

Following the completion of the Initialization Phase the relocatable object tapes of
the Basic Control System are to be loaded. Only those modules which are to be in-
cluded in the absolute tape are loaded; modules which are to be loaded with the
user's object program are not submitted. The modules may be loaded in any order
provided that the Relocating Loader is last. During this phase, the following halts
may occur:

When the Interrupt Linkage parameters have been supplied, PCS performs the fol-
lowing functions:

1.  Prints the message "*UNDEFINED SYMBOL" followed by the entry point names
    of all system subroutines which have been referenced as externals but not loaded.
    At this point, PCS may be rerun and the missing subroutines loaded or, the
    symbols may be added to the Relocating Loader's Symbol Table. Undefined sym-
    bols are assigned a value of 77777 for an absolute address.

2.  Completes the construction of the Loader Symbol Table.

3.  Sets the Memory Table (symbol location .MEM.) in the Relocating Loader to
    reflect the final bounds of available memory.

Following this, PCS prints a list of all Basic Control System entry points and the
bounds of the System Linkage area in the Base Page. As a final step PCS produces
the absolute BCS tape which can be loaded by the Basic Binary Loader. During final
processing, the following messages may occur:
