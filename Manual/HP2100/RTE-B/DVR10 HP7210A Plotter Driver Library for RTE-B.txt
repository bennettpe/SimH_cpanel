    TO SET UP THE PLOTTER'S LOGICAL UNIT:
 
       CALL PLTLU(LU) 
 
          WHERE        LU - LOGICAL UNIT WHERE PLOTTER
                            IS ATTACHED
 
 
    TO PLOT A LINE/POINT/MOVE THE ARM:
 
       CALL LINE(PC, MC, X, Y)

          WHERE        PC =  1 -> PEN DOWN
                       PC =  0 -> PLOT A POINT
                       PC = -1 -> PEN UP

                       MC =  0 -> X,Y ARE ABSOLUTE COORDS RANGE 0 TO 9999
                       MC = -1 -> X,Y COORDS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT
                                      PEN POSITION. COORDS RANGE -9999 TO 9999

                       X,Y = DESTINATION COORDS

 
    TO PLOT A SINGLE ASCII CHARACTER:
 
       CALL PLTC(IXX, IXY, IYX, IYY, CH)

          WHERE        IXX,IXY,IYX,IYY = SET COORDINATES OF CHAR 
                                         BOX (SEE BELOW)                                     

                       CH = ASCII CODE OF CHARACTER TO PLOT
                            IF <0, JUST SETS THE CHAR BOX, BUT DOES
                            NOT PLOTS A CHAR          

            THE PARAMETERS IXX,IXY,IYX,IYY ARE THE SIZE OF THE 
            BOX WHERE THE CHARACTERS WILL BE PRINTED. VALES RANGE 
            FROM -9999 TO 9999. IXX,IXY IS THE LOWER LEFT CORNER (CHAR 
            PLOT START), IYX,IYY IS THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER (CHAR PLOT
            ENDS)

            IXX = X INCREMENT FOR ORIGIN OF NEXT CHAR PLOT. 
            IXY = Y INCREMENT FOR ORIGIN OF NEXT CHAR. 
            IYX = X INCREMENT FOR END OF CURRENT CHAR PLOT. 
            IYY = Y INCREMENT FOR END OF CURRENT CHAR PLOT. 

            EXAMPLES

            PLTC(150,0,0,250,65)    PLOT AN "A" IN HORIZONTAL, WIDTH 150
                                    AND HEIGH 250

            PLTC(0, 100,-100,0,65)  PLOT IN VERTICAL DIRECTION

                                   
            PLTC(70, 30,-30,70, 65) PLOT ROTATED 30 DEGREES 
      

    TO DISPLAY AN ASCII STRING (TO BE CALLED FROM BASIC)
 
       CALL PLTCS(IASC)

       WHERE IASC = BASIC LITERAL OR STRING VARIABLE ADDR 
                    (NUM OF ASCII CHARS IN STRING IS FIRST WORD,
                     ASCII PACKED STRING)

                    USES THE CHAR BOX SET UP IN LAST PLTC CALL


            EXAMPLE: TO PLOT A STRING WIDTH W, HEIGHT H WITH A 
            ROTATION ANGLE A (DEGREES)

            LET A=30
            LET W=150
            LET H=200
            LET B=A*3.14/180
            LET I1=W*COS(B)
            LET I2=W*SIN(B)
            LET I3=H*COS(B+3.14/2)
            LET I4=H*SIN(B+3.14/2)
            CALL PLTC(I1,I2,I3,I4,-1)
            CALL PLTCS("HOLA")
