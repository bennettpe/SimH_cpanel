   ABSTRACT          - SYSTEM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (SPL) IS A HIGH LEVEL 
                       LANGUAGE FOR WRITING PROGRAMS SUCH AS COMPILERS AND 
                       OPERATING SYSTEMS.  SPL/2100 IS THE VERSION DESIGNED
                       FOR USE WITH THE HP 1000 SERIES COMPUTER.  THE
                       SPL/2100 COMPILER TRANSLATES SPL SOURCE PROGRAMS TO 
                       ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND THEN SCHEDULES THE RTE ASSEMBLER. 
                       THE COMPILER REQUIRES 15 PAGES AND MAKES USE OF THE 
                       LS AREA.

                       THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW TO: 
 
                            1. LOAD THE RELOCATABLE BINARY (OBJECT CODE) OF
                               THE SPL/2100 COMPILER, AND
 
                            2. COMPILE AN SPL PROGRAM AND PRODUCE THE
                               RELOCATABLE BINARY OF THE PROGRAM.
 
 
                       PROCEDURES ARE GIVEN FOR BOTH AN RTE II/III AND RTE IV
                       SYSTEM. 
 
 
                       1. LOADING THE SPL/2100 COMPILER. 
 
 
                       USE THE FOLLOWING TO LOAD THE SPL/2100 COMPILER.
 
                       IN AN RTE II/III SYSTEM:
 
                             :LG,16
                             :MR,MAG TAPE LU 
                             :RU,LOADR,99,LIST LU,...
 
                                       (SPECIFY A 15 PAGE PARTITION AND
                                       SEGMENTED PROGRAM TO THE LOADER)
 
                                       LOADR WILL RESPOND WITH SPL READY 
                             :

                       IN AN RTE IV SYSTEM:
 
                             :ST,MAG TAPE LU,%SPL:SC:CRN:5:750,BR
                             :RU,LOADR

                                  /LOADR:    EN
 
                                   LOADR WILL RESPOND WITH SPL READY 
                             : 
 
 
                       THE SPL COMPILER HAS 10 SEGMENTS, SG01C TO SG10C. 
 
 
 
                       2. COMPILING AN SPL PROGRAM.
 
                       SUPPOSE THE FMGR FILE "SOURCE" CONTAINS AN SPL PROGRAM. 
                       USE THE FOLLOWING TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM AND STORE THE 
                       RELOCATABLE BINARY (OBJECT CODE) IN A FMGR FILE CALLED
                       "OBJECT." 
 
 
                       IN AN RTE II/III SYSTEM:
 
                             :LG,N            N SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TRACKS
                                              FOR THE PROGRAM
                             :MS,SOURCE
                             :RU,SPL,2,LIST LU,99
 
                                  WHERE   2       - SOURCE PROGRAM IS IN LS
                                          LIST LU - LU FOR COMPILER LISTING
                                          99      - OUTPUT THE OBJECT CODE TO
                                                    THE LG AREA
 
                                 THE SPL COMPILER
                                     1.  ACCEPTS THE SOURCE POGRAM IN THE
                                         LS AREA,
                                     2.  TRANSLATES IT TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, 
                                     3.  STORES THE ASSEMBLY VERSION BACK IN 
                                         THE LS AREA, AND
                                     4.  SCHEDULES THE ASSEMBLER TO PRODUCE
                                         THE OBJECT CODE 
 
                             :SA,LG,OBJECT 
 
                                 THE OBJECT CODE NOW RESIDES IN THE FILE 
                                 "OBJECT."

                       IN AN RTE IV SYSTEM:
 
                             :MS,SOURCE
                             :RU,SPL,2,LIST LU,99
 
                                  WHERE  2       - SOURCE PROGRAM IS IN LS 
                                         LIST LU - LU FOR COMPILER  LISTING
                                         99      - OUTPUT OBJECT CODE TO 
                                                   THE LG AREA 
 
                                 THE SPL COMPILER
                                     1. ACCEPTS THE SOURCE PROGRAM IN THE
                                        LS AREA, 
                                     2. TRANSLATES IT TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE,
                                     3. STORES THE ASSEMBLY VERSION BACK IN
                                        THE LS AREA, AND 
                                     4. SCHEDULES THE ASSEMBLER TO PRODUCE 
                                        THE OBJECT CODE
 
 
                             HOWEVER, SINCE THE RTE-IV ASSEMBLER DOES NOT USE
                             THE LS/LG AREAS, THE ASSEMBLER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE 
                             THE PROGRAM CREATED BY THE SPL COMPILER.  THE 
                             ASSEMBLER ABORTS WITH A "NO INPUT SOURCE FILE"
                             ERROR.
 
                                     /ASMB:   $END  NPRG 
                                     /ASMB:   $END 
 
                             THE SOLUTION IS FOR THE USER TO SAVE THE LS AREA
                             AS A FMGR FILE AND THEN RUN THE ASSEMBLER WITH
                             THIS FILE AS THE INPUT SOURCE FILE.  SUPPOSE THIS 
                             FILE IS CALLED "ASMB-SOURCE." 
 
                             :SA,LS,ASMB-SOURCE
                             :RU,ASMB,ASMB-SOURCE,LIST LU,OBJECT 
 
 
                                 THE OBJECT CODE NOW RESIDES IN THE FILE 
                                 "OBJECT" AND CAN BE LOADED. 
 
 
                             EDITR MAY ALSO BE USED TO SAVE THE LS AREA
                             IN "ASMB-SOURCE."

                       SINCE THE ASSEMBLER IS SCHEDULED BY THE SPL COMPILER, 
                       THE ASSEMBLER'S MAIN AND ALL OF ITS SEGMENTS MUST HAVE
                       ID SEGMENTS (I.E. MUST HAVE BEEN RP'D) WHEN THE SPL 
                       COMPILER IS RUN.  IN ADDITION, IF A CROSS REFERENCE 
                       LISTING IS DESIRED, THE CROSS REFERENCE PROGRAM (XREF)
                       MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN RP'D.
