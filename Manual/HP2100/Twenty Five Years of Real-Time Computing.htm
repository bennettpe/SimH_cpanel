<P>REAL-TIME Interface, An Interex Publication 
<P>August 1991 </P></CENTER>The year 1991 marks Hewlett-Packard's 25th 
Anniversary in the computer business and the  Silver Anniversary of the HP 1000 
product line. To celebrate this milestone, it is our pleasure to  share with you 
a chronicle of the life of the HP 1000 product line thus far. The chronology 
that  appears below is the first installment in a three-part series, the 
remaining installments of which  will be published in future issues of REAL-TIME 
INTERFACE. The history presented here is based to a large extent on fuzzy 
recollection, anecdotes of ques- tionable accuracy, and detective-style 
guesswork. It is, no doubt, inaccurate and incomplete on a  number of subjects. 
The author welcomes any corrections or additional information the REAL- TIME 
INTERFACE readership wishes to provide. As this history clearly shows, 
Hewlett-Packard's experience in the computer business has been  far from 
perfect, and many hard lessons have had to be learned. Nevertheless, the HP 1000 
has  managed to endure for a quarter of a century as a direct result of the 
continued demand by our  customers. We at Hewlett-Packard thank you for 25 years 
of a valued partnership.

    <TD><B>1964</B></TD>
    <TD>In approximately June of 1964, people at HP's Dymec Division decide 
      that a new computer  should be the heart of future instrumentation 
      systems. Previous experiments with PDP-5  and PDP-8 computers from Digital 
      Equipment Corporation (DEC) have shown that custom  design work and 
      specialized software are needed to interface these computers to HP 
       instruments. Dymec wishes for a more flexible computer design that 
      simplifies the task of  connecting instruments to the computer. 
      <P>Engineers at HP's corporate research and development laboratories have 
      already outlined  the design of such a minicomputer, emphasizing a 
      flexible I/O system which can be easily  connected to measurement 
      instruments and other peripherals. 
      <P>Dymec Division is descended from a company named DYNAC, Inc., which was 
      founded  in 1956 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP. DYNAC was formed to 
      handle test  equipment systems, in particular, test equipment for missile 
      guidance systems then being  developed by the U.S. government. Originally 
      this project was a part of the HP R&amp;D Lab,  but a separate company was 
      spawned due to the specialized needs of the R&amp;D lab  involved, and 
      reportedly due to fears of reduced profit sharing for HP employees caused 
      by  the new business. In 1958 the company was renamed DYMEC, Inc. due to a 
      conflict with  an existing trademark owned by Westinghouse. HP acquired 
      DYMEC and formed Dymec  Division in 1959. The company logo of DYMEC was 
      simply an "hp" logo turned upside- down into a dy," superimposed on an 
      oval background. 
      <P>Also in 1964, HP purchases Data Systems, Inc. (DSI) of Detroit, a small 
      company owned  by Union Carbide, which employs five computer designers and 
      software experts, four of  whom subsequently join HP. Included in the 
      purchase are the rights to the design of a  computer, the DSI 1000. 
      <P>Dave Packard makes the decision to buy DSI after he becomes interested 
      in computers  and starts shopping around for a small company to buy. Bill 
      Hewlett agrees to the purchase  only after Dave agrees to call them 
      "instrument controllers" instead of "computers." Many  HP executives share 
      Bill's wariness of the new product line, not wanting HP to venture into 
       the fiercely competitive business data processing market. By 1969, Bill 
      will be partially  converted to the computer revolution, using an HP 2000 
      to keep track of the bull breeding  stock he and Dave run at Little Basin. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1965</B></TD>
    <TD>The first HP computer R&amp;D lab is formed through a merger of the 
      ex-DSI employees and  HP Labs employees. Dymec Division is deemed the 
      division best suited for building  computers because of its experience 
      with the DEC machines, and so the team is organized  as part of that 
      division and housed in a corner of the Dymec manufacturing building (7B) 
      in  Palo Alto. 
      <P>Software development is later moved to a trailer (with a leaky roof) 
      parked in the  executive parking lot next to Bill and Dave's offices. 
      Later still, software development is  moved to a basement and the 
      programmers are asked to use a special entrance to avoid  passing through 
      the other work areas. Although this request is made in part due to the 
       irregular work hours of the software team, it is also apparently intended 
      to keep the pro- grammers out of sight; the programmers are considered 
      "weird" by the other employees.  Most professionals at this time tend to 
      wear white shirts and ties, and look askance at the  long hair, sport 
      shirts, and sandals of the programmers. 
      <P>The design and release to manufacturing of the 2116A is accomplished in 
      one year. The  final hardware development is supposedly performed far more 
      quickly than the industry  average for systems of such complexity, and the 
      simultaneous availability of software with  the hardware is a unique 
      achievement, according to observers. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1966</B></TD>
    <TD>(Nov) The 2116A computer is introduced at the Fall Joint Computer 
      Conference in San  Francisco as the "brains" of HP's measurement systems. 
      The marketing group is  disappointed at the reception accorded by the 
      conference attendees. The 2116A is the first 16-bit minicomputer in the 
      industry (the PDP- 11 will be the  second). The design is very similar to 
      that of the PDP-8. The first "operating system" for  the 2116A is Software 
      I/O (SIO), which consists simply of a set of device drivers that is 
       loaded from paper tape before an application is then loaded which calls 
      those drivers. All  code written under SIO uses absolute addressing; no 
      relocating loader is provided. SIO  serves as the host system for the 
      other early 2116-family operating systems (such as BCS,  early RTE, and 
      DOS). The FORTRAN, ALGOL, and 2116 assembler languages are  available. 
      <P>Free with the 2116A is the Basic Control System (BCS), the first system 
      to be written on  top of SIO. BCS 
      <UL>
        <LI>	Loads and links relocatable programs 
        <LI>	Creates indirect and base page addressing when necessary 
        <LI>	Selects and loads referenced library routines 
        <LI>	Processes I/O requests and services I/O interrupts. </LI></UL>Like 
      SIO, BCS is loaded from paper tape and knows nothing of disc devices. BCS 
      is built  by the Prepare Control System (PCS), an SIO system. One unusual 
      feature of BCS is that it  fills unused memory with halt instructions so 
      that programs will halt if they try to execute  those locations. 
      <P>BCS can only handle one I/O operation on a device at a time. If a 
      request is issued for a  device that is busy, then the request is rejected 
      and the program must keep checking with  the IOC (Input/ Output Control) 
      subroutine to find out when the driver is available. A later  version of 
      BCS with the "Buffered IOC module allows output requests for low/ medium 
       speed devices to be buffered in available memory if the driver is busy.
       Two of the first instrumentation systems built around the 2116 are the 
      2018A Computing  Data Acquisition System and the 8542A Microwave Network 
      Analysis System. HP will proceed to release other processors in the same 
      family, henceforth called the  "21xx family":

    <TD><B>1968</B></TD>
    <TD>Palo Alto Division releases the original Real Time Executive (RTE). 
      RTE requires 16K of  memory (24K for the Algol compiler) and offers the 
      following features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Source, relocatable, executable code, and program data may be stored 
        on a drum disc. 
        <LI>Each program is designated as either real-time or background, and as 
        either core-resident  or disc-resident; all four resultant classes of 
        programs execute in different areas of core.  Background disc-resident 
        programs may be broken into disc-based overlay segments. 
        <LI>Programs can be executed concurrently (multiprogramming) based on 
        priority  scheduling. Only one real-time disc-based program can execute 
        at a time, but an optional  swapping feature allows these programs to 
        swap out so that a higher priority program can  run. 
        <LI>Memory-protect prevents programs from modifying other programs or 
        the system. All  I/O requests must go through the Executive (except for 
        privileged interrupts). </LI></UL>The introduction of RTE is met with many 
      complaints from users who encounter  problems with the functionality of 
      the operating system. 
      <P>The HP 2000A Time-Shared BASIC System is introduced, a 2116B processor 
      running a  multi-user system dedicated to running a BASIC interpreter.

      <P>HP 2000 sales will be discontinued in June, 1978 (although the 2026 
      communication  system will still be sold). 
      <P>(May 1) Systems Division is formed to build custom 9500-series 
      Automatic Test  Systems, staffed with employees from Palo Alto Division. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1969</B></TD>
    <TD>(Spring) Portions of Palo Alto Division concerned with computers (but 
      not the RTE  specialists) move to buildings 40 and 41 in Cupertino to form 
      the Cupertino Division. 
      <P>Around the same time as the formation of the Cupertino Division, the 
      Data Products  Group is formed, which includes the Cupertino Division and 
      the Mountain View Division.  The Electronic Products Group is also formed, 
      which includes the Palo Alto Division,  Systems Division, and the 
      instrument divisions. The data acquisition systems operations of  PAD are 
      made a part of Systems Division. 
      <P>At about this time, the Test-Oriented Disc System (TODS) is released. 
      It is essentially a  single-tasking BCS system with a disc driver and a 
      file system on the disc. The TODS  versus RTE controversy begins; people 
      interested in multi-tasking, multi-instrument  applications favor RTE, 
      while others prefer the superior interrupt response and freedom to 
       single-task applications offered by TODS. 
      <P>Sometime around 1969 the Disc Operating System (DOS) is written. DOS is 
      a single- tasking system based on drum discs that executes on 2116 or 2114 
      CPUs with at least 8K  of memory. DOS is oriented toward batch processing 
      of small business applications. Much  of the operating system is stored 
      out on disc and loaded as needed. 
      <P>According to legend, it is possible to generate your DOS system so that 
      the operating  system module that handles disc parity errors is 
      disc-resident. Another story avers that the  command which purges disc 
      files ("PU") will delete every file on the disc without  verification, 
      should no filename parameter be supplied. This feature is almost certainly 
       removed in later versions. 
      <P>The Data Acquisition and Control Executive (PACE) is also released in 
      1969. PACE aids  program development by allowing the operator to change 
      signals to be measured,  frequency of sampling, computation constants, and 
      so on by entering new values through a  teleprinter keyboard instead of 
      modifying the program. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1970</B></TD>
    <TD>The Magnetic Tape System (MTS) is released. MTS allows the user to put 
      programs on  mag tape rather than loading paper tapes for every program to 
      be executed. MTS consists  of a control program called the Inter-Pass 
      Loader (IPL) and SIO drivers, and can execute  the BCS relocating loader 
      from mag tape with the subroutine library also on tape. MTS is  built by 
      the Prepare Tape System (PTS). 
      <P>(Feb) The Automatic Measurement Division (AMD, affectionately known as 
      the  "Automatic Meeting Division") is formed from a merger of PAD and 
      Systems Division,  encompassing data acquisition and automatic test 
      systems. For a while there is "AMP East"  (Systems Division) and "AMP 
      West" (PAD). AMP gains responsibility for RTE from  Cupertino Division, 
      which is neglecting it in favor of DOS; AMP needs it to control its 
       systems. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1971</B></TD>
    <TD>The HP 2100A computer is introduced with these features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>First microprogrammable minicomputer in the industry 
        <LI>Memory expansion from 4K to 32K words 
        <LI>14 I/O channels, expandable to 45 with the I/O extender 
        <LI>Memory protect, dual-channel DMA, hardware multiply/divide 
        <LI>Optional hardware floating point processor 
        <LI>First switching power supply in a minicomputer. </LI></UL>
      <P>As the story goes, the 2100A is roughed out on a napkin at lunch and 
      becomes a project.  The power supply is reportedly based on work done by 
      Bill Hewlett (with Barney Oliver  and Ralph Lee). The 2100A project is 
      begun after the cancellation of a 1969-vintage processor project codenamed 
      "Omega," a 32-bit machine that is the first computer designated  by HP to 
      replace the 2lxx family of processors. The Omega design is pared down to a 
      16- bit machine and becomes the basis of the HP 3000; apparently, HP does 
      not believe a  sufficient market exists for a 32-bit minicomputer. 
      <P>Coinciding with the announcement of the 2100A is the gathering of the 
      data acquisition  and control systems into the 2100-based 9600 series. 
      DOS-M, which supports moving-head  discs, is introduced around this time. 
      <P>Soon after the introduction of DOS-M, the RTE which supports 
      moving-head discs  (sometimes referred to as "RTE-M," not to be confused 
      with the later memory-based  "RTE-M") appears. This RTE-M is released at 
      about the same time as the 7900 disc.

    <TD><B>1972</B></TD>
    <TD>(Feb) Cupertino Division and Mountain View Division, which 
      manufactures tape drives,  are merged into what will become Data Systems 
      Division. 
      <P>(Nov) The HP 3000 Computer System is first introduced. During the 
      development of this  computer, HP management declares for the second time 
      that the 2lxx family of processors  is to be obsoleted; the HP 3000 is 
      originally intended to execute all of the MPE (Multi-Pro- grammed 
      Executive), RTE, and Time-shared BASIC operating systems. Apparently, 
       porting RTE to the 3000 architecture turns out to be more difficult than 
      was initially  estimated. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1973</B></TD>
    <TD>RTE-II is introduced, an almost complete rewrite of the earlier RTEs. 
      It features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>2 partitions for disc-resident programs 
        <LI>Disc file system with FMGR interface 
        <LI>I/O Spooling, Multi-Stream Batch, Multi-Terminal Monitor. 
        <LI>RTE-B, the RTE BASIC Software System dedicated to running a 
        real-time BASIC  interpreter, is introduced around the same time as 
        RTE-II. </LI></UL>
      <P>Soon afterwards, RTE-C, the RTE Core-Based Software System, is 
      introduced, which is  a memory-based RTE-II. 
      <P>The first Distributed Systems product, DS-1, the 91701A/B Distributed 
      Systems Interface  Kit, is released, allowing a central 9600E/F RTE system 
      to communicate with BCS and  SIO terminal systems" running the Terminal 
      Communication Executive (TCE). TCE/1,  TCE/2, and TCE/3 perform functions 
      analogous to the later SCE/1, SCE/2, and SCE/3 of  the Satellite 
      Communication Executive (ca. 1976). 
      <P>Sometime later DS-lB appears, adding Program-to-Program (PTOP) services 
      but still  requiring the same star configuration. DS-1B' appears even 
      later (which allows RTE-III  systems to communicate with RTE-C systems). 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1974</B></TD>
    <TD>(Nov) The Computer Systems Group is formed to unify the computer 
      business, replacing  the Data Products Group. AMD is made a division of 
      CSG, and the portions of AMP  responsible for RTE and the 9600-series 
      Measurement and Control Systems are moved to  DSP. The DOS versus RTE wars 
      begin within DSP. 
      <P>Eventually RTE will replace DOS as the operating system for the 2lxx 
      family for these  reasons: 
      <UL>
        <LI>The HP 3000 becomes HP's primary business computer, and the DOS 
        group melts into  the 3000 group. 
        <LI>Enhancements to RTE, such as the File Management Package (FMP) and 
        the FMGR user  interface program, make it easier to access discs. 
        <LI>DSP wants to support only one operating system. DSP decides it is 
        easier to add DOS  functionality to RTE than to add real time and 
        multitasking to DOS. DOS will no longer be  offered by 1975-1976. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>The 21MX processor is introduced (later known as the "M-series"). The 
      21 MX adds the  Dynamic Mapping System (DMS) to the design of the 2100. 
      The 21MX may be the first  minicomputer to use semiconductor memory 
      (instead of core). 
      <P>The 21MX line of processors are:

      index registers are hampered by slow access speed;  it is faster to code 
      your own addition of an offset to a base address and reference the

    <TD>RTE-III is introduced around this time, with these features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Uses the DMS to put the OS and user programs in different maps, but 
        much OS table space is still included in the user's map 
        <LI>Supports memory expansion up to 256K words 
        <LI>Provides up to 64 partitions for disc-resident programs (from 2) 
        <LI>Supports 7900A and 7905A disc drives, disc-based Real-Time BASIC 
        <LI>Requires a 21MX with at least 32K words of memory. </LI></UL>
      <P>RTE-III is a "fast track" project, developed quickly to take advantage 
      of the DMS. 
      <P>DSD management declares with certainty that there will be no further 
      development on  RTE. However, between 1976 and 1977 a division review will 
      be held at which Bill  Hewlett asks why no resources have been allocated 
      to RTE and the HP 1000. According to  the R&amp;D section manager, 
      suddenly the RTE lab finds itself swamped with money and has  to invent 
      ways to spend it. 
      <P>Real-Time disc-based BASIC, a superset of RTE-B including a file system 
      similar to HP  2000 Timeshared systems, is introduced. 
      <P>The Satellite Communication Executives (SCE) appear at about this time. 
      SCE/1 and  SCE/2 are binary loaders for downloading absolute core images 
      from a remote Central  Communication Executive (CCE) host; SCE/2 is an 
      enhanced version of SCE/1 with an  interactive interface. SCE/3 allows a 
      variety of network functions to be performed between  an RTE-II or RTE-III 
      CCE and a BCS satellite host. 
      <P>(Jun) The first Computer Systems Communicator is published, containing 
      how-to articles  and Q&amp;A columns of the kind common to user group 
      publications today. It also contains  product change information for the 
      HP 2000/Access, HP 3000, and the HP 9600  Measurement and Control System, 
      with a common section for general 21MX-based  systems 
      (BCS/DOS/RTE/Timeshared). 
      <P>(Oct) The 21MXE, or "E-Series," processor is introduced and heralded as 
      40 percent  faster than the 21MX in execution speed. The old 2IMX 
      processor is now referred to as the  21 MX-M or the "M-Series," around 
      which RTE-M (the second one) is later based. 
      <P>(Oct) The HP 1000 system is introduced with the 21MXE, with these 
      features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Supports the 2644A, 2645A-007 terminals 
        <LI>Introduces IMAGE/1000, the first of HP's IMAGE products 
        <LI>Executes system generation and disc backups on-line 
        <LI>Replaces all 9600/9700s except the 9640A memory-based system. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>The Computer Systems Communicator switches to coverage of HP 1000 
      computers  instead of 9600/9700 Measurement and Control Systems. "Software 
      Samantha," the  pseudonym used in the Communicator by various DSD 
      personnel to answer questions  received by mail, assumes the HP 1000 
      software expert position vacated by 9600/9700  expert "Software Sam." 
      <P>The 21MX-K ("K-Series") Miniprocessor, the 21MX processing board, is 
      offered as a  component product. 
      <P>(Nov) RJE/1000, the "remote job entry" subsystem for submitting batch 
      jobs from 1000s  to IBM 360/370 systems, is introduced. 
      <P>(Nov) The 9600-series product line is transferred back to AMD. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>

    <TD><B>1977</B></TD>
    <TD>(Mar) Memory-based RTE-M (the second one) with variants RTE-MI, 
      RTE-MII,  and RTE-MIII is introduced as the Model 20 system. RTE-M is 
      probably based on RTE- III. DS/1000 is released with the following 
      features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Nodal addressing 
        <LI>Store-and-forward routing 
        <LI>Communication with HP 3000s running DS/3000 
        <LI>Arbitrary network topology, no longer limited to "star" 
        configuration </LI></UL>
      <P>The Communicator splits into three separate publications for 1000, 
      2000, and 3000 systems. 
      <P>(May) The 2026 data entry and communication system is introduced, a 
      product form of the 2000- based COMSYS communication system widely used 
      throughout HP. 
      <P>(May 1) Automatic Measurements Division (AMD) is absorbed into Data 
      Systems Division. 
      <P>About this time HP develops the HP 3000 "super-friendly" business 
      computers (originally  codenamed "Streaker" to emphasize speed, but later 
      renamed "Amigo" to emphasize  friendliness), although the computer is not 
      announced until October 1978 due to a late release. 
      <P>This is the third HP computer declared to be the replacement for the HP 
      1000 family; it is  intended to be a general-purpose computer before it is 
      reoriented to the business market.  Apparently the efforts at friendliness 
      reduce the realtime response and performance.

    <TD><B>1978</B></TD>
    <TD>(Apr) RTE-IV (later called RTE-IVA) is introduced with these features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>EMA; SHEMA not supported but people find it can be made to work 
        <LI>Large Background programs, which remove table areas and system 
        drivers from program logical space 
        <LI>Parity error handling 
        <LI>"Slow boot" online I/O and memory reconfiguration 
        <LI>File system support for ASMB, FORTRAN, LOADR 
        <LI>DBUGR 
        <LI>The "Logical Source" and "Load and Go" disc areas are obsoleted. 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>Around this time the "LX' project is proposed, which aims to add the 
      DMS (Dynamic Mapping  System) to the (as yet unreleased) L-Series CPU, 
      possibly as a coprocessor that would be  compatible with the E/F-Series. 
      This project is cancelled when the XL-Series project is begun.  However, 
      the former LX project evolves into the first A-Series processor project; 
      the A700  processor is code-named "Phoenix" because it "rose from the 
      ashes" of LX. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1979</B></TD>
    <TD>The F-Series processor is introduced with the following features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>New Floating Point Processor hardware two and a half to six times 
        faster than M/E-Series  firmware 
        <LI>Scientific Instruction Set (SIS) microcode 
        <LI>Larger memory extender capacity </LI></UL>
      <P>RTE-IVB releases, adding the Session Monitor to RTE-IV. Among the 
      features are: 
      <UL>
        <LI>User and group security for devices and files, including the Session 
        Switch Table (SST) 
        <LI>Spooling at the session level 
        <LI>Time-slicing </LI></UL>
      <P>The RTE-IVB project is originally named RTE-V, but is renamed because 
      of U.S. government  procurement rules in effect at this time. If it were 
      called RTEV, then the government would have  to renegotiate the contracts. 
      By naming it RTE-IVB, HP can claim that it is an "upgrade" to  RTE-IV, and 
      thus is covered under existing contracts. The RTE-6 project is apparently 
      begun  while the RTE-IVB project is still named RTE-V. 
      <P>(Aug) The HP 1000 International Users Group (IUG) is formed. 
      <P>(Oct) The L-Series ("Low-cost") processor is introduced with RTE-L, the 
      new RTE  design. This processor has no Dynamic Mapping System (DMS). The 
      system is packaged  in a large, squat box nicknamed the "washing machine." 
      This is the first system to feature  the Virtual Control Panel (VCP). 
      <P>(Dec) The PLUS/1000 (Program Library of User Software) is created after 
      reorganizing  the former LOCUS library, to be the responsibility of the HP 
      1000 International Users  Group. 
      <P>The Corporate Computer Systems (CCS) company releases its HP/C compiler 
      around  this time.

    <TD><B>1980</B></TD>
    <TD>(Oct 10) The XL-Series with RTE-XL is released, expanding the memory 
      capabilities of  the L-Series. The L- and XL-Series become little more 
      than a curious footnote in HP 1000  history, remarkable mainly as the 
      precursors to the A-Series particularly in the I/O system. The XL-Series 
      is a quick project, conceived in a Marriott hotel room, to add bank-
       switching to the L-Series on the memory card without modifying the 
      processor, thus  extending the memory size. As it turns out, the memory 
      controller of the processor is  modified to do this. 
      <P>Pascal/1000 is introduced. 
      <P>DS/1000-IV is released with the following features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Dynamic rerouting 
        <LI>Message Accounting for reliability 
        <LI>Data link layer handled by a microprocessor on the interface card 
        <LI>Modem links between l000s and 3000s </LI></UL>
      <P>(Nov) FORTRAN-4X is introduced. 
      <P>(Dec) RTE-IVE ("Execute-only"), a memory-based RTE-IVB which obsoletes 
      RTE-M,  is announced. 
      <P>At about this time, HP begins a project named the Vision Computer 
      Family (VCF), a  series of computers to replace all existing HP computers. 
      Thus, this is the fourth computer  designated as the successor to the HP 
      1000. The project is cancelled within the next two  years. 
      <P>Also at about this time the 2250 measurement and control system is 
      built around an L- Series processor. This system is an important precursor 
      to the R-cubed (later CDS) project  because the code is in PROMs. This 
      supplies insight into how difficult it is to implement  pure code on the 
      1000.

      <P>(Feb) The A600 ("Lightning") and A700 ("Phoenix") processors are
       announced - the A-Series ("the Automators") is born. The A-Series offers
       these features:

      <P>These processors run the forthcoming RTE-A.1 ("RTEsian") OS, based on 
      RTE-XL. Around this time, a marketing manager arranges for Jim Henson to 
      make muppets and  train two muppeteers for HP 1000 product promotions. 
      Known muppets are Luke  Warmwater, Dr. B. A. Buffoon, Bruno (BA's 
      assistant), and Dr. Blaze Pascal (another  version of BA). 
      <P>Release naming conventions change from the 4-digit revision codes to 
      "a.yy" format,  where "a" is an alphabetic release sequence indicator 
      within the year. The first release is  "A,"the second "B," and so on, and 
      "yy" is the last two digits of the year. This is apparently  to compensate 
      for releases slipping in units of weeks; the new format takes any 
      expectation  of a week number out of the release name.

      <P>HP management makes perhaps the first concentrated effort to halt new

    <TD><B>1986</B></TD>
    <TD>DSP switches to a new release naming scheme that removes any 
      references to intended  release dates. The new scheme uses dotted notation 
      to express major release and minor  release numbers, similar to the 
      numbering practiced by much of the rest of the industry.  The traditional 
      4-digit revision codes are expressed as a 4-digit version of the release 
       number, i.e., Release 4.1 will be designated "Rev. 4010." This doesn't 
      catch on in time for  the newly designated "4.0" release still in 
      progress, however; revision code 2540 is still  used in most 4.0 software. 
      Release names such as "A.85" are abolished. This change results  from 
      embarrassment caused by recent updates which went over schedule and were 
      released  in the year following the year specified in the release name; 
      the "B.84" update slipped into  1985 (becoming "A.85"), and the "B.85" 
      update has now slipped into 1986. Curiously  enough, the new release 
      numbers start at 4.0 to continue the sequence of internally  numbered 
      RTE-A versions RTE-A.1, RTE-A.2, and RTE-A.3.

      <P>(Nov) The D-MUX is introduced with these features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>38.4K baud rate support 
        <LI>Bi-directional XON/XOFF handshaking 
        <LI>User-definable termination characters; erasing backspace 
        <LI>Automatic baud rate generator configuration, port speed sensing 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>(Nov) The DSD 4.1 release provides these features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>New serial I/O drivers introduced which support the Rev-D MUX and 
        the OBIO 4- channel MUX 
        <LI>FST introduced 
        <LI>NS/1000 NFT (DSCOPY) supported to/from 9000s, 3000s, VAX 
        <LI>DataPair supported in BOOTEX (size grows to 768 blocks) 
        <LI>LAN/1000 software shipped with RTE-A, rather than LAN/1000 H/W 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>(Dec) The portions of DSD specific to manufacturing automation are 
      split into the  Industrial Applications Center (IAC). 
      <P>(Dec) RTE-IVB is discontinued, along with various E/F-Series products.

    <TD>(Feb) DSD is reorganized under the Manufacturing Systems Group, within 
      the Technical  Systems Sector (TSS). In June, the head of TSS will write 
      an article published to the HP  sales force that recognizes that the HP 
      1000 is a profitable product and encourages sales  reps to sell it when 
      appropriate, rather than always steering the customer to an HP 9000.  This 
      is perhaps the first statement by management that HP-UX cannot support 
      many real- time applications, and is, therefore, not a direct replacement 
      for RTE. 
      <P>(Feb) Corporate Computer Systems (CCS) releases the CCS/C 1000 
      compiler, an  improved C compiler with ANSI standard extensions. HP will 
      later license this compiler  from CCS as the HP C/1000 compiler. 
      <P>(Jun) The F-Series is discontinued (the E-Series lives on, however). 
      <P>(Aug) Snapshot/1000 is introduced. 
      <P>(Aug) The DSD 5.0 release offers the following features: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Ada compiler support: timers, signals, init'ed VMA, Link performance 
        (the compiler  itself remains unreleased) 
        <LI>User groups and the GRUMP utility 
        <LI>Security/ 1000, LU access bitmaps, volume ownership and protection 
        <LI>FMP "./" and "7 directories 
        <LI>NS offers TELNET (supported between l000s only) and RPM 
        <LI>Debug/1000 adopts running programs, supports Pascal better 
        <LI>RTE-A adds XSAM Extended System Available Memory 
        <LI>Many changes to Edit, Macro, CI, Pascal; RTE-A adds SCOM 
        <LI>New ASIC driver for MUX compatibility (ID100) 
        <LI>Supports Coyote, Eagle, Hero, Gnu devices </LI></UL>
      <P>(Oct) DSP moves from Building 42U in Cupertino to Building 101 in 
      Sunnyvale, of the  Pacific Technology Park (PTP) site. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1988</B></TD>
    <TD>(Feb) DSP is renamed to Technical Systems Division (TSP) within the 
      new Technical  Computer Group (TCG). Most of TSP now handles HP 9000s, 
      eventually splitting into  the Workstation Technology Division (WTD). 
      <P>(Feb) Networking release 5.05 supports TELNET between HP 9000s and 
      l000s. 
      <P>(Apr) Ada/l000 is announced, but is never marketed. It will soon be 
      taken off the price  list. 
      <P>(Nov) TSP is reorganized under the Computer Systems Group (CSG) and 
      renamed to  Data Systems Operation (DSO). DSO's "mission statement" is 
      formulated to encompass  future realtime projects without specifically 
      stepping on any other division's charter: "Real  time is the opportunity." 
      <P>Two new projects proposed by DSO engineers are soon given the go-ahead: 
      the 32-Bit  Real-Time project, which will become the "Next Generation" or 
      Precision Architecture  Real-Time (PA-RT or HP-RT) project, and a new 
      high-end A-Series processor design,  which will become the A990 
      ("Millennium") CPU.

        <LI>Peripheral support: 9153C, 9122C, LJ II,LJ 2000, Desk Jet, 7961A 
        </LI></UL>
      <P>RTE-IVB is frozen at 5.1 ($MATH library changes are causing problems). 
      <P>(May) Networking release 5.16 introduces ARPA/1000, a subset of NS/1000 
      dedicated to  the inter-vendor TCP/IP networking applications. ARPA/1000 
      includes functionality not  yet included with NS/1000, notably the FTP and 
      PING utilities, as well as support for  Ethernet LAN protocols. 
      <P>		(Sep) The E-Series family is discontinued. 
      <P>		(Nov) The A700 processor is discontinued due to declining sales. 
      Customers are buying  either the A600+ or the A900 instead. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR valign="top">
    <TD><B>1990</B></TD>
    <TD>The DSO 5.2 release offers the following features:

    <TD><B>1991</B></TD>
    <TD>(Feb) The portion of the Information Networks Division (IND) concerned 
      with 1000  networking products (NSARPA/1000 and such) is absorbed back 
      into Data Systems. 
      <P>(Mar) Release 5.22 of SCSI/1000 supports DAT and hard disk drives. 
      <P>(Apr) Release 5.23 of SCSI/1000 fixes a number of bugs. 
      <P>DSO modifies both the release numbering scheme and the 4-digit revision 
      code format to  add another digit of precision, thereby allowing patches 
      of off-cycle releases to be  expressed. The existing revision code format 
      of: <BR>(major_release)"0"(minor_release)(off-cycle_release or 
      patch_number) <BR>is amended to: <BR>(major _ release)(minor _ 
      release)(off-cycle_release)(patcb_number) <BR>where (patch_number) is zero 
      for any major/minor/off-cycle release, and non-zero for a patch to  a 
      release. Examples: 6000 = 6.0; 5240 5.2.4; 5231 = 5.2.3.1. 
      <P>(Jun 21) DSO is reorganized to become a part of the Measurement and 
      Control Systems  Division (MCSY): "MCSY West."

        <LI>TELNET supports block-mode applications 
        <LI>Performance improvements </LI></UL>
      <P>(Nov) The HP C/1000 C compiler is introduced. HP C/1000 is a slightly 
      modified version  of CCS C/1000, which HP has licensed from Corporate 
      Computer Systems, Inc. HP  C/1000 adopts the same revision number as the 
      corresponding CCS C/1000 product,  revision 3.2. At the same time, 
      revision 5260 (5.26) of Symbolic Debug is released, which  supports 
      HPC/1000. 
      <P>(Nov) SCSI/1000 release 5.25 supports booting RTE from SCSI devices.
