 
 
     CALL(1,P,R,X,Y)

     DO THE GIVEN PEN ACTION AND THEN MOVE THE PEN TO THE GIVEN 
     COORDINATES X,Y

     PARAMETERS

            P =  1 -> PEN DOWN
            P =  0 -> PLOT A POINT
            P = -1 -> PEN UP

            R =  0 -> X,Y ARE ABSOLUTE COORDS RANGE 0 TO 9999
            R = -1 -> X,Y COORDS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT
                          PEN POSITION. COORDS RANGE -9999 TO 9999

            X,Y = DESTINATION COORDS


     CALL(2,IXX,IXY,IYX,IYY)

     PLOT THE CHARACTERS GIVEN IN NEXT PRINT STATEMENT. CURRENT PEN 
     POSITION IS THE LOWER LEFT CORNER OF FIRST CHARACTER.

     PARAMETERS

            THE 4 PARAMETERS ARE THE SIZE OF THE BOX WHERE THE
            CHARACTERS WILL BE PRINTED. VALES RANGE FROM -9999 To
            9999. IXX,IXY IS THE LOWER LEFT CORNER (CHAR PLOT 
            START), IYX,IYY IS THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER (CHAR PLOT
            ENDS)

            IXX = X INCREMENT FOR ORIGIN OF NEXT CHAR PLOT. 
            IXY = Y INCREMENT FOR ORIGIN OF NEXT CHAR. 
            IYX = X INCREMENT FOR END OF CURRENT CHAR PLOT. 
            IYY = Y INCREMENT FOR END OF CURRENT CHAR PLOT. 

            EXAMPLES

            CALL(2,150,0,0,250)    PLOT CHARS IN HORIZONTAL, WIDTH 150
                                   AND HEIGH 250

            CALL(2,0, 100,-100,0)  PLOT IN VERTICAL DIRECTION

                                   
            CALL(2,70, 30,-30,70)  PLOT CHARS ROTATED 30 DEGREES 
      
            TO PLOT A STRING WIDTH W, HEIGHT H WITH A ROTATION 
            ANGLE A (DEGREES)

            LET A=30
            LET W=150
            LET H=200
            LET B=A*3.14/180

            LET I3=H*COS(B+3.14/2)
            LET I4=H*SIN(B+3.14/2)
            CALL(2,I1,I2,I3,I4)
            PRINT "HOLA"
