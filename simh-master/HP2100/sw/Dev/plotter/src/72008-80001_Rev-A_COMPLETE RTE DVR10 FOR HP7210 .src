***** THE COMPLETE RTE DVR10 FOR THE HP7210 PROVIDES LINE PLOTTING
*     AND CHARACTER LETTERING CABABILITIES WHEN OPERATING THE HP7210
*     ON RTE SYSTEMS.  IN DESCRIBING THIS DRIVER I/O REQUESTS FOR 
*     LINE PLOTTING ARE REFFERED TO AS POSITION CALLS AND I/O 
*     REQUESTS FOR LETTERING ARE REFFERED TO AS LETTERING CALLS.
* 
* 
*     WHEN THE COMPLETE DVR10 IS USED NO SPECIAL LIBRARY ROUTINES 
*     ARE REQUIRED TO DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE OR TO DRAW A LINE OF 
*     LETTERED CHARACTERS.
* 
* 
*     A POSITION CALL RESULTS IN THE ACCEPTANCE AND PROCESSING OF 
*     THE POSITION AND PEN CONTROL INFORMATION WHICH SPECIFIES ONE
*     OR MORE STRAIGHT LINE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLOTTER'S PEN. 
* 
* 
*     A LETTERING CALL RESULTS IN THE ACCEPTANCE AND PROCESSING OF
*     THE SIZE AND CHARACTER CODE INFORMATION WHICH SPECIFIES A LINE
*     OF LETTERED TEXT.  AFTER THE SIZE SPECIFICATION IS PROCESSED
*     THEN EACH CHARACTER CODE TO BE LETTERED IS CONVERTED INTO A 
*     SEQUENCE OF SCALED RELATIVE MOVES WHICH ARE TRANSMITTED TO
*     THE PLOTTER USING THE SAME PROCEDURES THAT ARE USED FOR 
*     POSITION CALLS. 
* 
* 
*     WHEN LETTERING IS NOT REQUIRED OR WHEN ALL THE LETTERING THAT 
*     IS REQUIRED IS GENERATED BY APPROPRIATE LIBRARY ROUTINES THEN 
*     A DRIVER WHICH PROVIDES CHARACTER GENERATION IS NOT NECESSARY.
*     IN THIS CASE THE MINIMUM RTE DVR10 (P/N 72007) CAN BE USED
*     INSTEAD OF THE COMPLETE RTE DVR10 RESULTING IN A SAVING OF
*     700 WORDS IN THE CORE REQUIRED FOR THE PLOTTER DRIVER.

*                  FOR USE BY THE CONTINUATOR SECTION OF THE DRIVER

* 
*          IF O=1  NO SIZE SPEC PROCESSING IS PERFORMED AND THE

* 
*                  THE OLD SIZE OPTION IS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE

*     CONTAINING N MOVES WILL HAVE A VALUE
* 
*    (IBFLN) = 3 + 2*N   WORDS OR

* 
*     BECAUSE A LETTERING CALL WITH AN ASCII SIZE SPCE REQUIRES 10
*     WORDS FOR THE SIZE SPEC THE BUFFER LENGTH USED FOR A LETTERING
*     CALL WITH AN ASCII SIZE SPEC AND N CHARACTERS TO BE LETTERED
*     CAN HAVE THE VALUES 
* 
*    (IBFLN) = 10 + INT((N+1)/2)  WORDS  OR 
*    (IBFLN) = -20 - N  CHARACTERS
* 
*     BECAUSE LETTERING CALLS USING EITHER BINARY OR 'OLD' SIZE 
*     SPECS BOTH REQUIRE THE 1ST 5 WORDS OF A BUFFER FOR SIZE 
*     INFORMATION THE BUFFER LENGTH USED WITH A LETTERING CALL
*     WITH A BINARY OR AN 'OLD' SIZE SPEC AND N CHARACTERS TO BE
*     LETTERED CAN HAVE THE VALUES

* 
* 
*     NOTE  IF A WORD COUNT IS USED TO REQUEST THE LETTERING OF AN
*           ODD NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ONE EXTRA CHARACTER WILL BE
*           LETTERED TO COMPLETE THE WORD COUNT.  UNLESS THIS EXTRA 
*           CHARACTER IS A SPACE IN THE BUFFER BEING PROCESSED
*           AN UNWANTED CHARACTER WILL BE LETTERED AT THE END OF
*           THE LINE OF LETTERING PRODUCED. 
* 
* 
*     NOTE  IF A LETTERING CALL CONTAINS A SIZE SPEC BUT DOES NOT 
*           SPECIFY ANY CHARACTERS TO BE LETTERED THEN A CARRIAGE 
*           RETURN AND LINE FEED WILL BE DRAWN AS IN THE STANDARD 
*           END OF LINE PROCEDURE.  THE LENGTH OF THE CARRIAGE
*           RETURN WILL BE DETERMINED BY PREVIOUS LETTERING CALLS 
*           AND THE LINE FEED WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE SIZE
*           SPECS FOR THE CURRENT LETTERING CALL.

***** RECORD FORMATS FOR COMPLETE RTE DVR10 ***** 
* 
* 
***** RECORD FORMATS FOR POSITION CALLS 
* 
* 
*     ONLY 1 TYPE OF RECORD CAN BE USED FOR A POSITION CALL.
*     SUCH A RECORD CONTAINS THE PEN CONTROL, MODE CONTROL, AND 
*     POSITION INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SPECIFY 1 OR MORE STRAIGHT 
*     LINE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLOTTER'S PEN. IF POSITION INFORMATION
*     IS GIVEN FOR MORE THAN ONE POINT THEN THE SAME CONTROL
*     VALUES WILL BE USED FOR EACH POINT GIVEN. 
* 
* 
*     RECORDS FOR POSITION CALLS HAVE THE FORM
* 
*    (WORD1)  FILLER WORD AT HEAD OF BUFFER (OR RECORD LENGTH)
*    (WORD2)  PEN CONTROL WORD
*    (WORD3)  MODE CONTROL WORD 
*    (WORD4)  1ST X COMPONENT

***** RECORD FORMATS FOR LETTERING CALLS
* 
* 
*     3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECORDS CAN BE USED FOR LETTERING CALLS. 
*     THESE 3 TYPES RECORDS CORRESPOND TO TYPE OF SIZE SPEC USED
