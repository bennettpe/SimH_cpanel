*  THIS ROUTINE IS USED BY CERTAIN BASIC DEVICES SUBROUTINES TO 
*   SET A FLAG(#RSFG). THIS FLAG IS INTEROGATED BY 'CALSB' WHICH IS 
*   THE BASIC SUBROUTINE PARAMETER PASSING MODULE. IF THIS
*   FLAG IS SET BY CALLING THIS ROUTINE THEN BASIC WILL 
*   PERFORM A SAVE RESOURCES TERMINATION. IF THIS ROUTINE IS NOT
*   CALLED (WHICH IS THE NORMAL CASE) THEN BASIC WILL PERFORM A 
*   SERIAL RE-USABLE TERMINATION. 
* 
*  THE ROUTINES THAT NEED TO CALL THIS ROUTINE ARE DEFINED AS 
*   THOSE THAT STORE VARIABLES LOCALLY OR MODIFY THEMSELVES IN
*   ANY WAY WHAT-SO-EVER. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHERE A USER CALLS 
*   A DEVICE SUBROUTINE TO STORE A DEVICE LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER 
*   LOCALLY FOR USE BY SUBSEQUENT SUBROUTINE CALLS.
