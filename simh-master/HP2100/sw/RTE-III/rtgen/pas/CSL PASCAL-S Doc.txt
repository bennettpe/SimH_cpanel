 **ABSTRACT:
  
  PASCS TRANSLATES SOURCE PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN PASCAL-S (A SUBSET OF THE   
  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PASCAL) INTO RELOCATABLE BINARY CODE. THIS CODE    
  MUST THEN BE LOADED ALONG WITH A RUN-TIME LIBRARY OF SUBROUTINES (ALSO  
  PROVIDED WITH THE SYSTEM), WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE EXECUTION.    
  IT IS POSSIBLE TO DECLARE, IN THE PASCAL SOURCE PROGRAMS, THAT SOME     
  ROUTINES (PROCEDURES OR FUNCTIONS) ARE EXTERNAL (WRITTEN SEPERATELY,    
  E.G. IN FORTRAN). THEY ARE LINKED TO THE CODE BY THE RELOCATING LOADER. 
                                                                          
  A FULL INSTALLATION AND USER MANUAL IS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE SYSTEM,  
  IN MACHINE-READABLE FORM.                                               
  
  
 **FILES IDENTIFICATION:
   (NOTE: FILES IN THIS CONTRIBUTION HAVE THE SAME NAME AS THE
     DOCUMENTATION FILE WITH THE LAST 2 DIGITS INCREMENTED.   
     E.G.: A00101, A00102, A00103, ETC.)
  
  FILE#  1: DOCUMENTATION FILE                                
  FILE#  2: PASCS - PASCAL COMPILER                           
  FILE#  3: PARUN - RUN-TIME LIBRARY                          
  FILE#  4: WRITEUP - INSTALLATION AND USER'S MANUAL          
  
  
 **LOAD INSTRUCTIONS: 
  
  THE FILE WRITEUP SHOULD FIRST BE LISTED. IT CONTAINS A FULL MANUAL      
  FOR INSTALLATION AND FOR THE USE OF THE COMPILER. IF LOGICAL UNIT 6     
  IS A LINE-PRINTER, ONE SHOULD USE THE COMMAND :ST,WRITEUP,6, TO OBTAIN  
  A PROPERLY PAGINATED TEXT.                                              
                                                                          
  ASSEMBLE, LOAD AND SAVE PACCC (THIS PRODUCES THE ABSOLUTE PROGRAM       
  PASCS). ASSEMBLE PADDD, AND SAVE THE RESULTING RELOCATABLE CODE IN A    
  FILE PARUN. CREATE A BINARY FILE PASBIN, WHERE THE COMPILER WILL STORE  
  THE RELOCATABLE CODE IT WILL PRODUCE. REFER TO THE WRITEUP MANUAL FOR   
  ALL DETAILS ABOUT COMPILING, LOADING AND RUNNING PASCAL SOURCE          
  PROGRAMS.
