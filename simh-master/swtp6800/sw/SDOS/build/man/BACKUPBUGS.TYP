SDOSDISKBACKUP 1.0 ERRORS FROM SCRAP PAPER (1979 to 1983)    Verify that these items are no longer problems! or consider    as improvements1.  Should allow a default retry to be specified at command time so    backup continues from error.2.  Got input error soecifing retry count.  Resulted in retry count on    error input over and over on same sector.3.  7/7/80  error 1045 on read sector 14006 at DEST    how many times to retry?  100    error 1045 on read sector... (INSTANTLY!)    Apparently does not attempt 100 times.4.  4/21/80  SDOSBKUP14 D0: to D1:    Are you sure?.. yes  (long wait, copies ? 1/2 disk)    then gives error: Cluster size too small to support file that big.5.  12/3/79  MSI  SDOSDISKBACKUP D2: to D0: EXCEPT ?    are you sure? yes    Backup aborted  <--- FIX CASE TESTS    Copy RDMAST?  <CR>    I got a "Disk is Write Protected"    Error trying to read sector 2 of the dest disk file during the verify    pass (BAD MSG ALIGNMENT: TOO WIDE FOR SCREEN. BREAK APPROPRIATELY)    (DURING THE VERIFY PASS? HOW??)    ...    How many times should I retry?  2 (or 0)    Channel is closed    Error 1032 at linne 410086.  Must allow Disk Full error to get thru7.  Write Protect on disk causes error 15 @ 1008.  Can't copy O byte file correctly9.  Complains if Source disk is write protected on (MSI)10. Print "Verifying" on disk to disk copiess on entry to verify pass11. Backup TO vs OVER12. Should examine bit in Directory to determine if file has been changed13. Should allow backup D0: to filename to allow floppies to be copied    onto larger disks14. Should allow backup file to Disk:  to allow reverse of 8), if file has    no wildcard present15. Case conversions everywhere throughout program16. SPEED IT UP!  Rebuild copy loop17. I got "disk is write protected" during verify pass: REDICULOUS18. Backup doesn't seem to recover from read errors19. 4/19/82  D0: to D1: copied DIRECTORY.SYS!19a. B protect?20. Claims D0: is dismounted when D0: is full.  DISMOUNT command returns    non-zero I/O operation count20a Due to SDOS problem, source file    (binary written by positioning) is longer than destination ==> ERROR21. 7/4/81  What is difference between "I got a verify error at sector xxx    on write disk, do you want to rewrite?" AND "verify error @512, Rewrite?"22. 10/10/83  BACKUP E3* EXCEPT *BIN,.... to D3:*    proceeded to backup first file E3FRED.ASM.    apparently next file located had same prefix as first    but different extension, then asked if FIRST filename should be backed    up over that name.  More evidence - did same dumb thing several more    times     Rick sez FIXED23. 9/28/83  When it asks new file name, is device dismounted? ((Confusion?))    Joe typed "D3:*" (new proceedure)  Where did it delete from?    Rick sez "all deletes are now explicit"24. Backup E3* changed except....*.SAV OVER D2:*    shouldn't backup .SAV files but it does (Ricks sez NO)    BACKUP--- OVER---    DISK IS FULL---  (A, S, C) ?ABORT    (STARTS COPYING SAME FILE AGAIN TO SAME DEVICE) (RICK SEZ NO)25. 5/2/82  SDOSDISKBACKUP doesn't preserve date!!?26. BACKUP Second drive in <blank><blank> input <blank> string!    BAD MESSAGE FORMAT27. 5/5/81  Reported by J. Murray    SDOSDISKBACKUP to D0:    <logically what's happening?>    <Sparse files with 1E6 bytes total>    .DISMOUNT D0:    .DELETE * EXCEPT *.SYS    .SDOSDISKBACKUP    <disk full>    .FILES    .FREE <sum of FILES&FREE only shows 50% of actual disk size!>    .SDOSDISKVALIDATE         <finds unallocated clusters>28. On MSI SDOSDISKBACKUP D0:BMP to D2:    floppy D0: has WP notch in WP mode. WP switch is    disabled,  Error 1048  D2: is not up!!??29. Require * after 2nd disk name if wildcard copy given, ie,    BACKUP D1:A*B to D2:*  just to be consistent with copy.    Add "continue at"....30. Shouldn't write on files that already exist.31. 7/7/81  Prints "LSN too small to support a file that big" and then goes    to DEFAULTPROGRAM)  Should simply skip the file.    2) Need way to continue Backup (perhaps AFTER FILENAME.)32. Have Backup list all files that match and ask for block verification.33. BACKUP no wildcard - shouldn't search DIR.34. Joe says, S2000 SDOS11e SDOSDISKUP itself to freshly init'd disk    never completes (takes >20 if computes minutes if completes)    BUS loading problem?SDOSCMDS bug: RENAME D0: should use lowercaseERRORMSGS.SYS: Non-integer operand to include  HEX$!!
