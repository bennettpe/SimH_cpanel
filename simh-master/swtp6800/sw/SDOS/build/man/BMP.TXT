                                *** Introduction ***


          BMP   is   a   program  which  facilitates  the  maintenance  and
          manipulation of  the  contents  of disks, disk files, and memory.
          Included are commands  for  symbolic entry and display of machine
          instructions (disassemble and assemble),   ASCII  and hexadecimal
          entry and display, as well as binary and decimal entry.

          User operation of the program  is the same regardless of the type
          of object being accessed, although some  commands are meaningless
          when accessing in a non-diskdump mode.


                                *** Access Modes ***



          BMP  has  three  addressing modes: memory, diskdump,  and  binary
          file.

          The memory mode allows the user immediate access  to the computer
          memory and in many ways is similar in operation and effect to the
          interpretive  debugger,  IDB.   Naturally,  if  the  user  is not
          careful while  in  this  mode, he may easily destroy the resident
          copy of SDOS.

          The diskdump mode  allows  the  user to examine the contents of a
          disk or diskfile in  its  'raw' form.  Locations specified by the
          user are the actual byte positions used in the file, as offset by
          a sector or cluster base  given  by  the user (see the section on
          access commands).

          The  binary  file mode allows the  user  to  access  the  program
          contained in a binary file as if  it  were  loaded  into  memory.
          This  means  that  the user can talk about  the  program  without
          regard to how it is stored on disk -- in fact, BMP will take care
          of  all the details involved in expanding the file  if  the  user
          adds new data!

                              *** Display Commands ***


          BMP  will  display  data  from  a  location  in an output  format
          selected by the user (the default display mode is ;H).

          ;A             ASCII: the contents of the location is printed out
                         as  an  ASCII  character  enclosed by apostrophes.
                         Should the  character not be a printing character,
                         its hexadecimal value is printed.

          ;O             OPCODE: the contents  of  the location are treated
                         as though it were  an instruction and its symbolic
                         form  is printed.  Relative branches  are  printed
                         with their absolute destinations rather than their
                         relative  displacements.   Undefined op-codes have
                         their hexadecimal  value  printed out preceeded by
                         'FCB'.

          ;H             HEXADECIMAL: 1 byte  is printed out in hexadecimal
                         representation.

          ;X             HEXADECIMAL:  2  bytes  are  printed   out  in
                         hexadecimal notation.


                                  *** Commands ***


          The  following is a  list  of  commands,  with  descriptions  and
          references to section names associated  with  each  command.  The
          following  notation  is used regarding objects  in  meta-brackets
          ('<>'):

          Lower case letters in meta-brackets describe special  keys.   For
          example, <cr> refers to the return key, <lf>  is a line feed, and
          <esc> is an escape.

          Upper  case  letters  in  meta-brackets  refer to strings with  a
          specific  syntactic  meaning.  For example, <E> is an expression.
          A full list is given below.

                              *** Expressions: <E> ***


          BMP  allows   simple   expressions  with  strict  left  to  right
          evaluation and no  parenthesis.   The  recursive definition is as
          follows:

          An expression <E> is:

          <E>+<E>       addition
          <E>-<E>       subtraction
          <E>*<E>       multiplication
          <E>&<E>       logical not
          <E>!<E>       logical or
          <E>#<E>       logical exclusive or
          -<E>          negation
          <HEX>         a string of digits consisting of 0 through F
          <DEC>\        a string of decimal digits followed by '\'
          <BIN>%        a string of binary digits followed by '%'
          .             the last opened location
          '<CHAR>       the ASCII value of <CHAR> (which is one character)

          The only restriction is  that  the  negation operator must be the
          first operator in the expression.    For example,

                        4*3+-2#7!3

          is not legal, while

                        -4*.+'b

          is legal.

          Note:  While BMP can display numbers in only hexadecimal, numbers
          may be input as binary, decimal, or hexadecimal.

                              *** Deposit Data: <D> ***


          This is data which is  intended to be written out by the user and
          takes two forms: symbolic and non-symbolic.

          The symbolic form has the syntax:

                        <OPCODE> <ARG>

          where the opcode is 'LDAA', 'ORAA', 'TSX', 'CLRA', etc.  <ARG> is
          absent when the opcode requires no  argument;   otherwise, it has
          the form:

                        #<E> or <E>,X or <E>

          #  indicates  immediate  addressing; ,X means indexed;  just  <E>
          means direct or extended addressing (direct is used if possible).
          The  argument must be separated from the opcode  by  exactly  one
          space.  For example:

                        LDAA 10+45,X

          The non-symbolic form has the syntax

                        $<E> or <E>

          Examples:     $101   $10+'a   24+.

                        BMP - Binary Maintenance Program


                               *** Simple commands ***


          There are a few simple commands which are used  most  of the time
          in BMP:

                        <E>/ - examine

          This command examines the contents of location <E>.  The data  is
          printed  out  in  the  mode  specified  by  the last mode setting
          command.

          Note: Because  some modes require more than one byte of data, the
          location specified by  the  user  is used as a starting location.
          For instance, in the  ;X  mode,  BMP  prints out the value of two
          adjacent bytes.

          In addition, the next deposit location is set to the address <E>,
          thereby  allowing the user to  change  the  data  with  the  next
          command.  No actual data is changed with this command.  Also, the
          symbol '.' is given the value of <E>, when used in expressions.

                        <cr> - close

          A <cr> 'disarms' the next deposit  location  so  that  it  is  no
          longer valid.  Afterwards, should the user try  to  deposit  data
          without doing a '/' command, he will be chastised with a 'I don't
          know where to deposit that!' error message.

                        <D><cr> - deposit and close

          The  data <D> is deposited at the next  deposit  location  and  a
          regular <cr> command is executed.

                        <lf> - examine next

          Acts as if the user had typed '.+n/' where  n  is  the  number of
          bytes last displayed.  Illegal if there is no valid next  deposit
          location.

                        BMP - Binary Maintenance Program


                        <D><lf> - deposit and examine next

          The  data  <D> is deposited in the next deposit location and  the
          contents of the location following the deposited data is shown.

                        ^ - examine previous

          Is  identical  to  '.-1/'.   Not  legal if there is no valid next
          deposit location.

                        <D>^ - deposit and examine previous

          Is identical  to  '<D><cr>.-1/'.   Not legal if there is no valid
          next deposit location.

                        <E>= - evaluate expression

          The equals command  merely prints out the value of the expression
          preceeding it.  The value  printed  out  may be used as the first
          operand in an expression following  the  '='  just as if the user
          had typed the value.  For example,  typing  '2+.=xxxx-10/' (where
          xxxx is printed by BMP) is both legal and useful.

                        <E1>,<E2>/ - display multiple locations

          Starting at <E1>, the contents of memory or disk are displayed on
          the  terminal.  If <E2> is a hex  number  with  less  than  three
          digits or is an expression less than 256, locations are displayed
          through <E1>+<E2>;  otherwise, they are displayed through <E2>.

          If the display mode is ;O, the display is in symbolic format.  If
          the display mode is not ;O, locations are  displayed  as both hex
          numbers  and  ASCII  characters.  Pressing <esc> during the print
          out will cause the display to abort.

                        BMP - Binary Maintenance Program


                                  *** Searching ***


          BMP will  search  the  designated  source for a specified target,
          using a specified  mask  to  select  the  bits  to be used in the
          comparison.  A list of  all locations meeting the search criteria
          will be displayed.

          The source is designated by  one  of the three access modes.  The
          target is specified by

                        <E>?T

          and the mask is specified by

                        <E>?M

          The current search target and mask may be displayed by

                        ?

          yielding

                        TARGET = xx  MASK = xx

          The search is initiated by

                        <E1>,<E2>?S

          where <E1> and <E2> are the  lower  and upper inclusive bounds of
          the search.

          The  search  mask tells BMP what parts  of  the  target  to  take
          seriously; each byte of the mask corresponds to  a  byte  of  the
          target (so the mask must be as long as the target).  A bit set to
          1 in a mask byte says to ignore that  corresponding  bit  in  the
          byte being compared with the target byte.  A bit set  to  0  says
          that  the corresponding bit in the byte being compared must match
          exactly.

                        BMP - Binary Maintenance Program


                               *** Access commands ***


          ;M

          All references  go  to  memory  after  execution of this command.
          This is the default mode.

          <file>;B

          All locations referenced  by  the  user  are  translated  to disk
          addresses and the reference  made  to the  specified binary file.
          If the file contains records  which  will  overlap  other records
          when loaded into memory, BMP directs  the reference to the record
          which would be loaded last.

          When an examined location is not found in any of the records, the
          value zero is displayed.  When a deposit  location does not exist
          in any of the records, a new record is created.

          Note:  Because of the translation involved in converting a memory
          address to a disk address, binary mode runs  slightly slower than
          memory or diskdump modes.

          <file>;D

          All references go to the specified disk or disk  file.  Since BMP
          and  the  user can only discuss locations in the range  of  0  to
          65535, BMP has a provision for dealing with files that have 65536
          or more bytes in them.  The user is allowed to specify  an offset
          which is added to the user's location to produce an absolute file
          location.  This offset can be specified in either of two forms: a
          base  sector  or  a  base  cluster.   Thus, if the user wishes to
          change byte 3E of sector 5F5 to a zero, he need only type

                        5F5;S
                        3E/ xx  $0<CR>

          To set  the  offset  to  sector  <E>, type '<E>;S'.  To set it to
          cluster <E>, type  '<E>;C'.   An automatic '0,nbps/' is performed
          upon execution of these commands (nbps is the number of bytes per
          sector).

                        BMP - Binary Maintenance Program


                              *** Filenames: <FILE> ***


          <FILE> is a valid SDOS file name, including device names.

          Examples:     sdos.sys  D0:defaultprogram  wd0:



                            *** Information Commands ***

          Information  commands  give  information  about  a  file  or  its
          structure.

                        <FILE>;L

          This command gives a list  of  load  records  in  the object FILE
          selected.  It is most useful for determining where an object file
          loads into memory.

                        <FILE>;H

          This  command  locates  the  file named  in  the  directory,  and
          displays the displacement into the directory for  filename  entry
          and the header cluster of the FILE.  The  value  displayed can be
          used  in  conjunction with <DISK>;D and xx;C commands to  examine
          the file header cluster.



                           *** Miscellaneous Commands ***

                        <E1>,<E2>;C

          This  command computes the sum (modulo 256) of the bytes  between
          the addresses E1 and E2, inclusive.



                                   *** Errors ***


          Most  error  messages  issued  by BMP are self explanatory.  One,
          though, may  be  a bit confusing: 'Are you sure you want to write
          on the disk  DEVICE?' This message occurs when a disk device (not
          a file) is open in diskdump mode and the user is attempting to do
          a deposit.  This is  merely a safety check, and typing 'YES' will
          pacify BMP.  Typing anything else  will  abort  the  deposit  and
          issue a disk write-locked error.

          Error messages printed out are of two varieties: those which have
          an 'AT LINE xxxx' tacked to the end and those that do not.  Those
          errors which have a line number  are issued by SDOS and relate to
          some I/O problem (like file not found, etc.).  Those not followed
