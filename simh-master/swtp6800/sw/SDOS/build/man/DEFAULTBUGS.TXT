          DEFAULT  PROGRAM  BUGS  1.   6/22/83  Bug  in SDOSDEFAULTPROGRAM/
          Junk.* does NOT include Junk.
              (comment: Not  a  bug  "."  was  specified.) 2.  .Time should
          print out TIME  HH:MI  MO/DD/YY  Backspaces.   3.  12/11/83 DEBUG
          filename under mt on chief crashes system. (comment:
              Default program has no  recovery from DEBUG syscall failure.)
          4.  Copy command on disk  to  disk  copy  should use mapalgorithm
          written on
              disk.  Would be far more efficient!  5.  "files" should print
          byte  total.   6.   Copy  D0:  to  D1:  should  copy  both  using
          mapalgorithm  of D0:!  7.  SDOSCMDS print using  field  in  FILES
          doesn't allow for 10^12 byte field.  8.  SDOSCMDS  2/19/81 Rename
          disk:   should  permit  (and  pass)  lower  case!   9.   10/28/80
          Defaultprogram needs Debug logic moved to upper part of PZ.
              Put size of debug logic in manual?  10. Defaultprogram INCH$
              How about  wildcard  rename?   11. Defaultprogram get rest of
          line (22000) does  1-byte  reads!!  12. Speed up directory search
          by asking for null directory entries?
              Speed up FILES by  reading  32  bytes  at  a  pop?  (comment:
          already done?) 13. Default 11D "Debug" doesn't seem to work?  14.
          SDOSCMDS11d.bas:
                    .COPY sd1:fid<CR>
                    are you sure you want to write on the disk device?
                    (comment:  kind of odd response,  s/b bad comd format.)
          15. 4/17/82 6809 Copy command failed  to  copy INITIALIZE.SYS off
          6809 SDMT1.2C
              disk (wrong CR C obtained.) 16. 8/1/82  on MSI
              Copy D0: to (D2:)MSI.disk<CR>
              .CRC D0:
              :9CAx
              CRC D2:MSI.disk
              :818B   <different CRC! why?>

              .CRC Default Program
              :E303
              <BMP shows sector 4CF, byte FF of D0: to be zero.
               Shows sector 4CF of MSI.disk to hold 4F!>  17. 1/20/82 Throw
          away  defaultprogram  if  buffer space needed.  18. 12/30/82 Copy
          disk to disk shouldn't read a large part, and then re-read
              after..  are  you sure?  19. SDOSCMDS should NOT believe size
          of boot.sys>32. (see MOUNT command:
              gives subscript error  if  MOUNT<CR>  and  boot.sys  size  is
          wrong:
              fix in validate program)  20. Copy disk device to disk device
          gets last byte of last  sector wrong.  21. Delete should use last
          specified disk device as default drive.   22. Any unused space in
          directory entry, possible util pgm use for link
              alphabetically 23. Copy should preserve date.  25. Copy won't
          copy an all-zero sector at EOF.  26. Why hard formatting?
