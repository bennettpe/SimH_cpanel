NEW OPTION SWITCHES            The  following  new  option  switches have been implemented.            They are  specified  at  the  time the file specification is            requested  at  the   start   of   program   execution.   The            requirement  for  comma  separators   for   multiple  switch            specifications has been deleted, and  they are now optional.            For   example,  "MANUAL/R:10,E,M"  and  "MANUAL/R:10EM"  are            equivalent.                  I - INDEX MODE SWITCH.                  This switch is used in conjunction with the Index File            Entry (.IX)  Command to produce a rudimentary index file for            subsequent processing by  an  index generator program.  When            this switch is specified, the normal output is inhibited and            the  output  specification  selects  the  index  file.   The            default extension for the index  file  is ".IDX".  Each time            an  Index File Entry Command is  encountered  in  the  input            file,  the  .IX  parameter  is written to  the  index  file,            followed  by  a  separate  line containing the current  page            number at the time the .IX was encountered.                  M - MULTIFILE INPUT SWITCH.                  Specification  of  this  switch  allows multiple input            files to  be  effectively  concatenated  and  processed as a            single file.  When  the  end  of  file  (or  .EN command) is            encountered in the input file, another file specification is            requested from the user.   Additional files will continue to            be requested until the user  responds  with  only a carriage            return  to  signal  end  of  processing.    This  option  is            exclusive of merge (.ME) processing; either merge processing            or multifile processing may be specified, but not both.                  N - NON-STOP MODE SWITCH.                  Any  Stop (.ST) or User Input (.UI)  Commands  in  the        Copyright 1980 AMS               1                      02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2            input  file  are  ignored  and  processing continues without            stopping.  This option is effectively an override of the .ST            and .UI commands.                                    R - RESTART SWITCH.                  Specification of  this  switch  allows  output  to  be            inhibited until the  specified page number has been reached.            The entire input file  is  processed  as  usual; however, no            data is written to the  output  until  the  restart  page is            encountered.  The switch is specified in  the  format "R:p",            where "p" is the page number at which output is to commence.            The page number may be any valid  page  number; i.e., 5.708,            32,   B.19,   etc.   Once  the  specified  page  number   is            encountered,  output  processing  will commence and continue            normally through  the end of job.  During the portion of the            processing in which the output is inhibited (while searching            for the restart  page  number),  page  stops  (option switch            "P"),  error  stops (option  switch  "E"),  and  Stop  (.ST)            Commands are inhibited.  Their function  resumes when output            processing  commences.   Processing  for  User  Input  (.UI)            Commands  continues  normally throughout the restart process            since user  input  is  reflected  on the output page and may            affect paging.                                    S - SELECTIVE OUTPUT SWITCH.                  This switch is  used in conjunction with the Selective            Output (.SO) Command.  The switch is specified in the format            "S:n:n:...:n"; where "n" is  any  number  between 1 and 255.            Up to nine switch parameters  ("n")  may  be  specified, and            they may be in any order;  i.e.,  "S:5:103:3:87:255:1".  The            only portions of the input text that  are  output  are those            that are "common" or preceded by a .SO command which matches            one  of  the  "S"  switch  parameters.   If the  input  file            contains  .SO commands but the "S" switch is not  specified,            the entire input file is processed to the output.                              2.    NEW COMMANDS.                                    .AC - ACCENT COMMAND (BREAK).                  This command specifies that accenting is to be enabled            and that the characters specified by the parameter are to be            used  as  accents.   If  the  parameter  is  omitted, accent            processing  is  cancelled.   The  parameter  may  specify  a            maximum of ten  characters  to  be  used  as  accents.   The            allowable number may be less than the maximum depending upon            the number of characters  specified  in  the  Characters  To            Accent (.CA) Command.  The number of accent characters (.AC)            times the number of characters to accent (.CA) cannot exceed            32.  For example, if eight  characters  to  be  accented are        Copyright 1980 AMS               2                      02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2            specified, only four accent characters may be specified.  No            character may be specified as an  accent  character that has            already been specified in a Characters To  Accent  (.CA)  or            Substitute  Space  Character  (.SC) Command.  Accents may be            applied only  to  those  characters  specified  in  the  .CA            command; or to  the  default  characters "a", "e", "i", "o",            and  "u" if no  .CA  command  is  specified.   A  diagnostic            message is issued if an  accent  is  applied  to  any  other            character.    The   accent  must  immediately  precede   the            character to which it is to apply.  For example:                       .AC `^                       en ^etre l`a                                         ^      `            appears on the output as "en etre  la".   The backspace code            (hexadecimal 08) is utilized in accomplishing this function.            Any  device  to which such output is directed  must  support            backspacing.  The command is specified as follows:                       .AC x             Example: .AC ^~`                                    .AD - ADDRESS COMMAND (BREAK).                  This  command  specifies that following text lines are            to be  placed  in  an address table for subsequent output at            end of job processing.  The optional parameter specifies the            number of spaces that the address is to be indented from the            left page perforation when the envelope is output at the end            of  job.   The   end   of   the   address  is  signified  by            specification of another .AD  command  without  a parameter.            Each line of input text  encountered between the .AD command            specifications  is  placed  in  the  address  table  without            change.    No   tabbing,   accenting,  or  substitute  space            character replacement  is  performed  for  the address lines            placed in the  table.   No concatenation or justification is            performed on any text  encountered between the .AD commands.            The address lines are truncated if they exceed the currently            specified page width (.PW) at  the time of output, minus the            indentation  specified  in  the  .AD  parameter.   Only  one            address  may be specified in any one  TYPE  execution.   Any            additional  .AD  specifications  cause  a  diagnostic  error            message to  be  displayed and they are ignored.  The maximum            number of characters  that  may be specified for the address            is 350, minus 1 for each line of the address.  At the end of            job processing, the operator is given the option of printing            or not printing the  address  as  desired.   This command is            designed for inside addressed letters  where the printing of            an envelope is normally required.  The  command is specified            as follows:                       .AD n             Example: .AD 35        Copyright 1980 AMS               3                      02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2                                    .CA - CHARACTERS TO ACCENT COMMAND (BREAK).                  This command specifies the characters to which accents            are  to  be  applied.   This  command  is   valid   only  in            conjunction  with  the  Accent  (.AC) Command.  The optional            parameter specifies  those characters which may be accented.            If omitted, the  accenting process is cancelled.  If the .AC            command has been specified, but no .CA command is specified,            only the default characters  "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u" may            be accented.  A maximum of  32 characters to be accented may            be specified.  The allowable number may  be  less  than  the            maximum  depending upon the number of accents  specified  in            the  .AC  command.   The  number of accent characters  (.AC)            times the number of characters to accent (.CA) cannot exceed            32.  For example, if only one accent character is specified,            up  to  32  characters can be accented.  Conversely, if  ten            accent  characters  are  specified, only three characters to            accent may be specified.  No character may be specified that            has already  been specified in an Accent (.AC) or Substitute            Space Character (.SC)  Command.  Refer to the description of            the Accent (.AC) Command  for  further  explanation  of  the            accenting process.  The command is specified as follows:                       .CA x             Example: .CA aeioucn                                    .CC - CONTROL CODES COMMAND (BREAK).                  This   command  specifies  that  the   control   codes            specified in the parameter are to  be passed directly to the            output device.  All formatting and page control  by  TYPE is            bypassed.   Except  for the deletion of any formfeed  codes,            the  parameter  is  output  without change.  This command is            intended to  provide  a  means  of  sending control codes to            printers to initiate  special  effects,  such  as  alternate            fonts.  The user must exercise care when using this command.            If the parameter contains control codes which cause carriage            movement  to  occur  on  the  printer,  the  line  and  page            formatting   will  become  maladjusted.   The   command   is            specified as follows:                       .CC x             Example: .CC ^G                                    .CD - CURRENT DATE COMMAND.                  This  command  causes the current system  date  to  be            written  to  the  output  in  the format  specified  by  the            optional  parameter.   If  a  parameter  value  of  "G"   is            specified,  the  date  is  output in Gregorian format (month            day, year); i.e., June 2, 1981.  If a parameter value of "E"            is specified,  the  date  is  output in European format (day            month year); i.e., 2 June 1981.  If a parameter value of "N"            is  specified,  the  date  is  output  in  numerical  format            (mm-dd-yy); i.e., 06-02-81.  If  no  parameter is specified,        Copyright 1980 AMS               4                      02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2            default is to Gregorian format  "G".   Any  parameter  value            other than "E", "G", or "N"  causes  a diagnostic message to            be issued and the command is ignored.  The generated date is            processed as though it had been obtained from the input text            file in regards to any formatting that may be in effect.  If            concatenation  or  justification is in effect, the  date  is            concatenated and justified in the usual manner.  A  space is            inserted  after  the  date  in the normal manner, except  as            noted in the following paragraph.                  Specific   parts  of  the  date  may  be  selected  by            appending "M"  (month), "D" (day), or "Y" (year) to the "E",            "G", or "N"  format parameter.  The command ".CD GM" outputs            only the Gregorian month;  for example, "February".  If this            option is specified, the date  is  processed  differently so            that  punctuation  may  follow the date,  if  desired.   The            portion  of  the  date selected is processed  as  though  it            occurred at the beginning of the following input  line.   If            the  following  input line begins with a period, it  is  not            treated  as  a command, but as text data.  If the  following            input line begins with a tab or space, it does not  cause  a            break.   No  space is inserted in the output after the date.            If a  space  is  desired,  it  must be provided as the first            character on the  following  input  line.   Please  refer to            Section 3 for examples of the use of this option.                  This command is valid  only  if  your operating system            supports a clock, and the  system  date  is  in  the  format            "mmddyy"  or  "mm/dd/yy".   The  command  is   specified  as            follows:                       .CD x             Example: .CD E                                    .IM - IMAGE MODE COMMAND (BREAK).                  This command specifies that the number of  input lines            specified  by the parameter is to be copied  to  the  output            exactly as is.  The line is printed at the left margin (.LM)            and is truncated if it exceeds the currently specified  page            width  (.PW - .LM).   Input lines beginning with periods are            processed as  data  rather  than as command lines.  Embedded            blank lines and  multiple  carriage returns are not ignored;            they  are  processed  as  input  data  lines.   No  tabbing,            substitute  space  character  replacement, or  accenting  is            performed.     No    formatting   such   as   concatenation,            justification, indentation,  undentation,  offsetting, etc.,            is performed.  The command is specified as follows:                       .IM n             Example: .IM 5        Copyright 1980 AMS               5                      02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2                                    .IX - INDEX FILE ENTRY COMMAND.                  This command specifies  that  an  index entry is to be            written to the output  index file.  The parameter is written            to the output index file,  followed  by  a  carriage return.            The current page number is then  written to the output index            file,  followed  by  a  carriage  return.  This  command  is            ignored if the Index Mode Switch "I" was  not specified when            TYPE was run.  The command is specified as follows:                       .IX x             Example: .IX segmentation                                    .LB - LINE BREAK COMMAND (BREAK).                  This command specifies that a break is to occur  after            each line of input text (after each carriage return).  It is            equivalent  to  inserting  a  Break (.BR) Command after each            input text  line.   It  is  primarily intended to facilitate            generation  of lists  of  data  where  normal  concatenation            and/or justification is desired  for  each  element  of  the            list, but where each list  element  is  to  be  treated as a            separate entity and not concatenated to  other  elements  of            the list.  Any formatting commands in effect  prior  to  the            specification  of  the line break command remain in  effect.            Concatenation, justification, offsetting, indentation, etc.,            are processed as usual.  While in line break mode, the break            for a selected text line may be inhibited by  specifying the            Ignore Next Break (.IB) Command preceding the line for which            no  break  is  desired.   Line  break  mode  is  selected by            specifying the  .LB  command  with  a  parameter  field of 1            (".LB 1").

The  command  is  specified  as            follows:                       .LB n             Example: .LB 1                                    .PO - POSITION TO LINE NUMBER COMMAND (BREAK).                  This  command  specifies  that  the  paper  is  to  be            positioned  to  the line number specified by  the  parameter            prior to printing the next text line.  If  the  current line            position  is  already  beyond  the  line  specified  by  the            parameter, the  command  is  ignored.

The  optional            parameter  may  specify  a starting position and  up  to  20            alignment  columns.  If the parameter is omitted, the  right            alignment  process is cancelled.  The first parameter is the            starting position  at  which  the  alignment  process  is to            begin.   This allows  text  to  the  left  of  right-aligned            columns to be processed normally.  Alignment columns must be            specified in ascending order  and  must  be  less  than  the            current  line  length  (.LL).   If   a  parameter  error  is            encountered, setting of the alignment columns  ceases at the            point  the  error  occurred; i.e., if ".RA  1,5,10,9,20"  is            specified,  alignment will occur only at columns 5  and  10.            All  column  specifications  are relative to the left margin            (.LM) and  are independent of any indentation commands.  The            text is aligned  at  the  next  specified  alignment  column            number that is greater  than  the current output column.  If            there is insufficient space to align the text, it is aligned            at the next alignment column in which it will fit.  If there            are  no further alignment columns  specified,  no  alignment            occurs.   Text to be right aligned  should  be  followed  by            tabs.   All  spaces  or  substitute  space characters  (.SC)            following  the  word  are treated as part of  the  word  for            alignment  purposes.   All  other  commands  may  be used in            conjunction with  the  .RA command; including concatenation,            justification,  tabbing, underlining,  and  centering.   The            command is specified as follows:                       .RA s,n1,n2,...

This  command,  in            conjunction with the Selective Output Switch "S", allows the            user to select portions of the  input  text  to be processed            depending upon the "S" switch parameters.  The  .SO  command            is used to bracket portions of the input,  including command            lines  if  so  desired,  for  output selection.  If the  .SO            parameter  is zero or null, the data so bracketed is  always            selected  as  "common"  data  and  is always output.  If the            parameter is  other than null or zero, it is compared to the            "S" switch parameters  specified  at  the  start  of program            execution.  If an equal  match  occurs,  the text is output.            If no match occurs, the  text  is  bypassed.   The specified            parameter may be in the range  of  zero  to 255.

If the optional parameter is specified,            it is  displayed  on  the  console device at the time of the            halt as a prompt to the operator.  Execution is resumed when            the operator presses  the carriage return key.  This command            is useful when a  change  in  paper  or  typewriter  font is            desired.  The processing halt initiated  by this command may            be overridden by specification of the  Non-Stop  Mode Switch            "N".  The command is specified as follows:                       .ST x             Example: .ST INSERT LETTERHEAD                                    .UI - USER INPUT COMMAND.                  This command specifies that the next input  text  line            is  to be requested from the terminal operator  rather  than            from  the  currently  specified input file.  If the optional            parameter is  specified,  it is displayed as a prompt on the            console device prior  to requesting the input.  The operator            must terminate the input by entering a carriage return.  All            guidelines and restrictions pertaining  to normal text input            apply to operator keyboard input,  except  that a maximum of            136  characters  may  be  entered.  If  a  period  (".")  is            encountered  as  the  first character of the  input,  it  is            processed  as a command line rather than as  text  data.   A            null  response  may be entered; it is treated as  though  no            operator  input request had been specified.  No break occurs            if text  data  is input.  If concatenation is in effect, the            operator's input is  concatenated  as  usual.   If a command            (preceded by a period)  is  input  which  normally  causes a            break, or line break mode  (.LB)  is in effect, then a break            will occur.

If  the            parameter  "E" is specified, the next printed page is forced            to an  even  page  number;  if  "O"  is  specified, the next            printed page is  forced  to an odd page number.  If the next            page number that would  have been output normally is not odd            or even as specified by  the  .PA parameter, a blank page is            generated  in  order  to  force  the  page  to  be  numbered            appropriately.   The  page  so  generated contains only  the            headers,  identifications, and page number.  For example, in            a bound  book  with chapters, the first page of each chapter            can be forced  to  an  odd page number.  Normally, even page            numbers appear on the  left side and odd page numbers on the            right side of bound volumes.   If the last page of a chapter            is numbered 27 and a ".PA  O"  command  is  specified;  page            number  "27"  is  output,  a  blank page  numbered  "28"  is            generated, and the next page (first page of the new chapter)            is numbered "29".                                    .SH - SUBHEADING LINE COMMAND.                  If  no subheading line is specified, none is  printed.            In prior versions, a blank line was printed if  there was no            subheader.                                    .TM - TOP MARGIN COMMAND.                  The  top  margin  may now be set to zero, if  desired.            The  user must insure that no heading, subheading, or top of            page numbering  (.AP/.TP)  has been specified; otherwise, an            error occurs and the command is ignored.                              4.    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.                  Upon completion of  processing,  TYPE  returns  to the            asterisk prompt to input  another  file specification rather            than terminating.                  The Address (.AD) Command and  the  table  of contents            processing share the same storage area for address lines and            table  of  contents  page  numbers.  If  both  features  are            selected,  the  maximum  amount  of  storage  for   each  is            effectively reduced.                  Only  ASCII  printing characters (hexadecimal 20 - 7E)            and tabs  (hexadecimal  09)  should be included in the input            text file.  All other codes may conflict with and affect the            accenting  and  underlining  processes.   If  accenting  and            underlining are not in effect, such codes are passed through            to the output without change or alteration by TYPE.

USAGE EXAMPLES.                                    ACCENTING (.AC/.CA COMMANDS).                  The  Accent  (.AC)  and  Characters  To  Accent  (.CA)            Commands allow accenting  of  selected  characters.  The .AC            command  specifies the accent  characters  and  enables  the            accenting process.  Specification of the .AC command without            a  parameter  causes accenting to  be  cancelled.   The  .CA            command specifies the characters to which  accents are to be            applied.  If no .CA command is specified;  default is to the            vowels  "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u".  Specifying  an  accent            for any other character causes a diagnostic to be  displayed            and  the  accent  and  the  following character to be output            without change.   The  maximum  number  of accent characters            which may be  specified  is  ten,  and the maximum number of            characters to be accented  is  32.   However,  the number of            accents times the number of characters to be accented cannot            exceed 32.  For example, the  following combinations (number            of  accents : number  of  accented  characters)  are  legal:            1:32, 2:16, 3:10, 4:8, 5:6, 6:5, 7:4,  8:4,  9:3,  and 10:3.            No character may be specified in the .AC  command  that  has            already  been specified in the .CA command, and vice  versa.            No  character  may  be  specified  in either command that is            currently  specified   for   use  as  the  substitute  space            character (.SC).  Care  should  be  taken when selecting the            characters to be used as accents.  If the command ".AC m" is            specified,  any  .CA  characters   following   an  "m"  will            overprint the "m".  Additionally, a  diagnostic is issued in            all cases where any other character  follows  the  "m".  New            .AC and .CA commands may be specified at any point to change            the  characters  involved  in  the accenting process.   When            accenting   is   in   effect,  the  processing  overhead  is            significantly increased.  While processing files with only a            few accented characters, it is recommended that accenting be            cancelled for  portions  of the text that do not contain any            accents.      Accenting     utilizes     backspace     codes            (hexadecimal 08).  Any device to  which  accented  output is            directed must support backspacing.  The  following  examples            illustrate the use of accenting.                  .AC ^`                  .CA aeioucAEIOUC                  .OP                                    .BR                  g^ateau, n.m.

Additionally,  no  concatenation nor            justification is performed on  any  text encountered between            the  .AD  commands.  When the  end  of  the  input  file  is            encountered, the operator is given the option of printing or            not printing the envelope address.  If the envelope printing            is selected, the lines in the  address  table are printed in            image mode (.IM).  The following example illustrates the use            of the Address Command.                  .CD                  .SP 2                  .AD 45                  Mr. H. C.

The parameter can            specify numeric  ("N"),  Gregorian  ("G"), or European ("E")            date format.  If  no  parameter is specified, the default is            to Gregorian format.                  If only the month,  day, or year is desired; that part            may be selected by appending  "M" (month), "D" (day), or "Y"            (year)  to  the  format  parameter.

If concatenation  is            in effect, it will be concatenated in the normal manner.                  If only a part of the date is selected, TYPE processes            it in a different manner in order to allow punctuation to be            appended  to  the  date, if desired.  Instead of writing the            date directly  to  the  output, it is processed as though it            had been inserted  at  the  beginning of the following input            line.  If the following  input line begins with a period, it            is treated as text data  rather  than as a command line.  If            you wish to follow the date  with a period, it must occur as            the  first character of the following input  line.   Do  not            precede  such  lines  with  .IG commands.  If the  following            input line begins with a tab or space, it  does  not cause a            break.   No space is inserted in the output after the  date.            If  a  space  is  desired, it must be provided as the  first            character on the following input line.        Copyright 1980 AMS               19                     02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2            The  following  examples  illustrate  the use of the Current            Date Command:                  The invoice was dated                  .CD N                  and was due and payable within one week.

The Index  File  Entry  (.IX)            Command is specified at appropriate locations throughout the            document to write a descriptive header and the  current page            number into an output index file.  The index file  may  then            be  processed through an index generator program.  The Index            Mode  Switch  "I"  must  be  specified  when  TYPE  is  run,            otherwise all .IX commands are ignored.                  The .IX command  parameter supplies a descriptive text            header to be associated  with  the page number placed in the            index file.  The parameter is  written  to  the  index file,            followed by a carriage return; then  the current page number            is written to the file, also followed  by a carriage return.            No formatting of the parameter or page number is performed.                  If   page   numbers   are  changed  by  the  user   by            specification  of .AN or .DD commands, the change should  be            initiated  immediately  after the prior page eject.  The .IX            command causes  the current page number to be written to the            index file.  If the current page number is changed after the            .IX command is  specified, the page number in the index file            will reflect the page  number  before the change rather than            after.  For example, if the  page  number  is changed in the            middle  of the page, all .IX  commands  encountered  in  the            first half of the page will reflect  the  wrong page number.            Care  should  always be taken when explicitly changing  page            numbers  rather  than allowing TYPE to automatically control            page numbering.                  In the  following  example,  explicit Page Eject (.PA)            Commands with parameters  are used to illustrate clearly the            current  page numbers at  the  time  the  .IX  commands  are            specified.  Normally, page ejects are  due  to  normal  page            overflow rather than to explicit page ejects.                  .BP                  .IX Batch job initiation, TSS                  INITIATION OF BATCH JOBS IN TSS.                  .SP                  .IX Batch jobs utilizing tape handlers, TSS                  1.

The  end of the input text line, designated by a            carriage return, causes a break to occur while in line break            mode.  This precludes  the  necessity for insertion of Break            (.BR) Commands between each  list  element.   Breaks between            lines may be inhibited by use of the Ignore Next Break (.IB)            Command,  if  desired.   Line break  mode  is  initiated  by            specification  of  the .LB command with  a  parameter  of  1            (".LB 1").

Input  merge  file  ADDRESS.TYP  is a            customer address master file, which also contains additional            information as to the product most recently purchased by the            customer.  Input merge file SALE-LTR.TYP is a form letter to            be  printed  for  each  customer,   announcing  a  sale  and            referencing  the  recently  purchased product.  Input  merge            file ME-EJECT.TYP is used to force a  page  eject  when used            with  the  ADDRESS.TYP  master  file  to print envelopes  or            standard size 1-1/2 inch mailing labels.  The information to            be  selected and printed in each case is determined  through            use  of  the Selective Output (.SO) Commands embedded in the            input  files,  in  conjunction  with  the  Selective  Output            Switch S parameters specified when TYPE is run.                  The merging of  the  two  input files is controlled by            specification of Merge (.ME)  Commands  in each of the input            files.  Care must be taken  to  insure  that the files match            regarding  merge  points  and the data  to  be  merged.   If            punctuation   is   required  immediately  following  a  word            obtained from  a  merge  file,  it must be included with the            word in that file.                  To  print  envelopes   for   each   customer   in  the            ADDRESS.TYP master file, files  ADDRESS.TYP and ME-EJECT.TYP            are used with S switch parameters "S:2:3".  Switch parameter            2 selects the addresses, while  switch  parameter  3 indents            the  addresses on the envelopes by  37  spaces.   Page  Stop            Switch P  is also specified so that the  printer  will  stop            after each envelope and the next envelope may  be  inserted.            The file specification is as follows:                       PR:=ME-EJECT,ADDRESS/S:2:3,P                  To  print  address labels for each customer instead of            envelopes, files  ADDRESS.TYP and ME-EJECT.TYP are used with            S switch parameters "S:2:4".  Switch parameter 2 selects the            addresses, while switch  parameter 4 sets the indentation to            zero so the address will print at the left margin.  The file            specification is as follows:                       PR:=ME-EJECT,ADDRESS/S:2:4                  To print the sales  letter  for  each  customer, files            ADDRESS.TYP   and  SALE-LTR.TYP  are  used   with   S switch            parameters "S:1:2", as follows:                       PR:=SALE-LTR,ADDRESS/S:1:2        Copyright 1980 AMS               26                     02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2            The following shows the contents of the input files required            for the merge processing, followed by the output produced by            TYPE for each of the above three cases.            Contents of the master file ADDRESS.TYP:                  .CM File ADDRESS.TYP                  .CM                  .CM To generate envelopes or labels for mass mailing                  .CM which contain only the address portion of this                  .CM file, use the Selective Output Switch 2 in                  .CM conjunction with the merge file ME-EJECT.TYP.                  .CM                  .CM This merge file sets up a page length of 9                  .CM lines for standard 1-1/2 inch mailing labels.                  .CM For envelopes, use the Page Stop Switch P.                  .CM Use Selective Output Switch 3 for 37-space                  .CM indentation on envelopes, or use Selective                  .CM Output Switch 4 for 0-space indentation on                  .CM mailing labels.                  .CM                  .CM Start of selective output 3 definition:                  .SO 3                  .LL 37                  .LM 37                  .NP                  .BM 0                  .HM 0                  .TM 2                  .PL 9                  .NF                  .SO                  .CM ---------------End selective output 3.                  .CM                  .CM Start of selective output 4 definition:                  .SO 4                  .LL 37                  .LM 0                  .NP                  .BM 0                  .HM 0                  .TM 2                  .PL 9                  .NF                  .SO                  .CM ---------------End selective output 4.        Copyright 1980 AMS               27                     02-07-84/V2.3               TYPE USER'S MANUAL            ADDENDUM 2                  .CM                  .CM J.

The optional parameters specify            the starting  position  at which the alignment process is to            begin and the  columns at which the text is to be aligned in            the output.  If omitted,  right alignment is cancelled.  The            first parameter is the position at which the right alignment            process is to become effective.   This  allows  text  to the            left of the aligned columns to  be  processed  in the normal            manner,  as  shown  in  the  example  below.    The   column            specifications  are  relative  to the left margin (.LM)  and            ignore  any  currently  specified indentation.  A maximum of            twenty alignment columns may be set, and they may be changed            at any  point.   Right  alignment  remains  in  effect until            cancelled by specification  of  a  .RA  command  with a null            parameter.   The  text is  aligned  at  the  next  specified            alignment column number that is  greater  than  the  current            output column.  If there is insufficient  space to align the            text, it is aligned at the next alignment column in which it            will  fit.   If  there  are  no  further  alignment  columns            specified, no alignment occurs.  It is recommended that text            that  is  right  aligned be followed by a  tab.   Spaces  or            substitute  space  characters  (.SC) following the text word            are treated as part of the word for alignment purposes.
