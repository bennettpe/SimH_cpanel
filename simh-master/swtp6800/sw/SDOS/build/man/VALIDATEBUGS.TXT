          should check BOOT.SYS for >=32 bytes
              Otherwise, disk  ID  can't  be  read  from  file  BOOT.SYS 2.

              is  write  protected.   However Diskmap is  already  updated.
          This causes
              inconsistency.     5.    Validate:    check   BOOT.SYS   data

          sparse.
